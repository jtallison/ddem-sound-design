## Daily Listening Jornals 

- - -
Deep Listening is a way of hearing in which we are fully present with what is happening in the moment without trying to control it or judge it. We let go of our inner clamoring and our usual assumptions and listen with respect for precisely what is being said.

For listening to be effective, we require a contemplative mind: open, fresh, alert, attentive, calm, and receptive. We often do not have a clear concept of listening as an active process; we often see listening as a passive, static activity. 

As a daily classroom practice, we will witness thoughts and emotions while maintaining focused attention on what we are hearing. Each day class period we will listen to at least one sound recording and react by taking notes, creating drawings or making other records of our thoughts in both an abstract and analytical musical mannor.  This may be done while listening or directly after depending on the assignment and the student's listening habits.

While initally instuctors will present sound recordings for listening journal entries, eventually this process will be student led as the school year develops.

Pauline Oliveros was an American composer and central figure in the development of experimental and post-war electronic art music.  Among many things she pioneered thought on "deep listening" and "sonic awareness".
