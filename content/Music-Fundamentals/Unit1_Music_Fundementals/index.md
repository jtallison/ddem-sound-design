# Unit 1: Music Fundamentals

Welcome to Sound Design! In this course we will be focusing on two main topics. THe majority of this course will be on creating your own sounds and songs using the software Studio One 6, but before that we will spend some time discussing important music and computer audio fundamentals. Unit 1 will focus on musical concepts, while Unit 2 is all about how computers work with sound.

If you have already taken a music theory class or have been in band, choir, orchestra, etc. Than you may already be familiar with some of the concepts we discuss here. This is not an in-depth course on music theory, but we will be going over enough of the content for you to be able to easily create and discuss your music throughout the year.

## Listening

Before we dive into Music theory, we should discuss listening. Listening is a large part of this class. After all, how can you create music without listening to it? Why are you making music if no one will listen to it? How can you talk about music without listening to it? Generally, the answer to all of these questions is "you can't" (or at least it is INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT to do anything meaningful).

As we move through the material there will be several times to listen to a variety of music with various assignments attached to those times. You teacher may adjust the specifics of when each of these happen, but here we will discuss all three of those main opportunities, as well as the concept of Deep Listening.

### Ear Training

As we work through Unit 1 there will be several opportunities to practice your ear training. These exercises will present you with various audio samples that play concepts we have been discussing. The goal of these assignments is to hear something and be able to identify what it is. If you don't know what a major chord sounds like, then why would you use one in your music?

Periodically links to [musicthoery.net](musicthoery.net) will appear that will take you to ear training exercises. 

### Listening Journal

It is recommended that each class meeting start with listening to some music. The specifics of this are at the discretion of the teacher. By listening to these concepts used in the real world and exploring new genres of music, you can start to develop or further identify exactly how you feel about different musical ideas and more quickly decide what you do and don't like about a song as well as how to fix those issues. Whenever a listening happens in class, students should keep a listening journal to be submitted for a grade. The journal should include some basic information, but mainly be a freeform response to what is being listened to. Be sure to include:

* The date this listening is happening
* The song title
* Who is performing in the recording?
* What year was the track released?

After those, the students should be listening to the content and responding to what they hear. What stands out to them? Do they like or dislike certain things **AND WHY DO THEY FEEL THAT WAY**? As the year goes on the teacher may guide the students to listen for specific things in the song such as form, instrumentation, use of effects, etc. A sample listening is given below:

Date: today
Track: Miracles out of Nowhere
Artist: KANSAS
Year: 1976
To Listen for: Panning

Response: This song has a lot of moving parts. The instruments are playing constant moving lines, but the voice is always the loudest thing. At the beginning basically everything is panned center or close to it. The main vocals and backup vocals sound very similar to each other; I didn't notice they were different people at first. Panning becomes noticeable when we get to the chorus. On the words "Here" and "There" the backup vocals are hard-panned left and right in order to make those words sound like they are coming form somewhere else. This evolves as the song plays. I really enjoy this as it adds a new layer to the song without taking away anything from the soloistic nature of all the instruments. It is especially useful because of how close to center everything else is by comparison.

Songs can come from a variety of sources, genres, and artists. One recommendation is to create a class playlist to hold everything you listen to over the course of the year. It can also be fun to have students submit their favorite song to the list as an option for future listenings.

### Guided Listening Presentation

By the end of the year students should have listened to a wide variety of tracks showing a wide variety of music. As they become more practiced at listening to music and responding to what they are hearing, they will be required to give a short presentation on a track for the class. This presentation is designed to have students listen to new music, as well as show their understanding of the music through deep listening and historical research. Students may work on the presentation individually or in group of 2-3 at the discretion of the teacher. The presentation should be between 6 and 10 minutes in length, including time to listen to the entire song.

Instructions:

1. Song Selection: Use the list below in order to choose your song. No duplicate songs should be presented in each class so have a backup ready when selecting.
2. Powerpoint: Your presentation must be on either a powerpoint or google slides presentation. Relevant information, links to songs, pictures, etc. must all be on the presentation. This will be what is submitted following your presentation. Your slides should have the following sections:
    * Background information: Provide some context about the song and artist. Be sure to include:
        Who the artist is and any notable produces or talent they may have worked with in the recording process
        When the song was released and on what album (if applicable)
        Anything else related to the song that we will not hear in the music.
        Any sources that are not common knowledge (dates, names, places, etc.) MUST be cited in the final slide of the presentation. Do not use wikipedia as a source. Interview, web-articles, and social media posts by the artists are all acceptable.
        **This section should take no more than 2 minutes**
    * Listen For: A quick slide that shows a few interesting key elements of the song to listen for. Help to prepare the audience for listening to the song.
        **This section should take no more than 30 seconds**
    * 3-5 slides that provide a guide for what is happening in the music. You will be showing (and only showing, not talking about) these slides and changing from one to the next in time with the music. While it plays. 
        Slides should be concise enough for your audience to read without being distracted from the listening experience. 
        The total number of slides will vary depending on the form of the song. 
        Each slide should have a few important bullet points for that section - What changed from the last section? What should we be listening for now? What are any especially important or striking features of this section? Is there anything that strays from the primary elements that you originally told us to listen for?
        **This section will vary in length depending on the song, but should not exceed 5 minutes.**
    * Guided Discussion: Choose one single feature from the song that you would like to explore further – a transition, the sound of one particular synth, some social commentary on the lyrics, etc. Lead a discussion on this topic. You should hear from a few of your classmates during this section. You can use a few short listening examples from your song during this discussion to illustrate your point - make sure you have the track times sorted out ahead of time!
        **This section should not exceed 2 minutes and 30 seconds**
3. Slides should be submitted to your teacher prior to your presentation. If the timeline guides are followed, the presentation should be exactly 10 minutes in duration. If one section is shorter, then others can be longer so long as the total time does not exceed 10 minutes.


#### Listening Presentation Track List

Use this list in order to choose a song for your presentation. Songs outside of this list may be utilized following approval by your teacher. You should include both what the song it and why you want to present it when asking about external options.

Songs are arranged alphabetically by Artist. All links are to youtube. A Spotify playlist of the list is available [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5OxyQuPevovwmrKDRTmwSH?si=b607e4f81cda4207).

### Deep Listening

The Last Listening concept we will discuss in this section is the idea of Deep Listening. Pioneered by American composer Pauline Oliveros, Deep Listening is (put simply) the idea of intentionally listening, focusing on how you are listening and responding to the sounds as much as the sound content itself, and applying that to what you are working on. In practice, it comes up as more than just hearing whatever is playing, but instead focusing on various elements to dive into the content and see what there is to gain from it. Oliveros describes the idea and practice of Deep Listening best in a 2015 TED Talk: 

?![oliveros-dl-ted-talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QHfOuRrJB8)

when listening to various songs in class, including your own projects, try and approach the experience with Deep Listening in mind. Remind yourself when you are not listening. Be aware of what you are listening to, what is present in the sound, and how it interacts with other sounds and yourself. This is not an easy thing to do any will take a lot of practicing in order to get used to. Luckily, this course has a lot of things to listen to!

## Pitch

Pitch is how musicians talk about a sound's frequency. In a performance setting where hundreds or thousands of notes are played in a few minutes, referring to a sound frequency with a small collection of names is much more practical than having to calculate what to play with numbers. Western musical pitch is represented with letter names as follows:

* A
* B
* C
* D
* E 
* F
* G

The specific notes will repeat over and over again. This loop is called an octave because the repeated note is the 8th in the sequence above the original pitch. We can refer to the specific octave with a number. "Middle C" on the music staff is C4. The C below is C3, and the one above is C5. A standard 88 key piano has the pitches A0-C8.

In terms of frequency, it doubles every octave. So C5 has a frequency twice as high as C4 and four times as high as C3. This doubling is what helps us hear the same note at different octaves.

### Flat and Sharp

We will talk more about how to read music later in this unit, but we haven't quite covered every note on a keyboard. A-G mentioned previously only account for the white keys on a piano. The black keys on a keyboard have slightly longer names. When played together, A and B sound pretty close, but an additional note can actually fit in that space (The specifics of musical intervals will be coming up soon.). To help keep these other notes related to the short list of 7 pitches, musicians simply indicate if the notes previously mentioned have been raised or lowered to the closest black key.

The phrase 'sharp' indicates a note has been made one piano key higher, while the phrase 'flat' indicates that the pitch has been lowed by one piano key.Using these new notes, an octave will have 12 equally spaced notes within it, indicated by the repeating pattern of piano keys. You mau have noticed that if you follow this process, you will have different names for the same pitch. E.G. Moving one step above C and one below D will be the same key on the keyboard. These pitches are called enharmonic. Enharmonic pitches sound the same, but the name used to refer to the pitch will change depending on the context of the music around the note. Doing this allows for the music to be easier to read and analyze. The full list of these pitches is:

* A
* A sharp/B flat
* B
* C
* C sharp/D flat
* D
* D sharp/E flat
* E
* F
* F sharp/G flat
* G
* G sharp/A flat

Notice that there is no black key between B/C and E/F. The same sharp/flat rule still applies, so B sharp is the same as C natural.

### Solfedge

The visual symbols used to refer to all of these notes will come up later, but we can still give these notes names to refer to them and sing. A system called solfedge was developed in the 11th century and used as another way to mention pitch. The original latin syllables are largely unchanged from the original:

* Do
* Re
* Mi
* Fa
* Sol
* La
* Ti
