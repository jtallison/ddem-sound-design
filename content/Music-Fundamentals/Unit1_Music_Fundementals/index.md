# Unit 1: Music Fundamentals

Welcome to Sound Design! In this course we will be focusing on two main topics. THe majority of this course will be on creating your own sounds and songs using the software Studio One 6, but before that we will spend some time discussing important music and computer audio fundamentals. Unit 1 will focus on musical concepts, while Unit 2 is all about how computers work with sound.

If you have already taken a music theory class or have been in band, choir, orchestra, etc. Than you may already be familiar with some of the concepts we discuss here. This is not an in-depth course on music theory, but we will be going over enough of the content for you to be able to easily create and discuss your music throughout the year.

Periodically throughout units 1-9 are several small multiple choice quizzes. As you are going through the material, take a moment and give them a shot to see how well you are understanding the material. You can attempt the quizzes as much as you would like, but will need to refresh the page to fully reset the quiz.

## Listening

Before we dive into Music theory, we should discuss listening. Listening is a large part of this class. After all, how can you create music without listening to it? Why are you making music if no one will listen to it? How can you talk about music without listening to it? Generally, the answer to all of these questions is "you can't" (or at least it is INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT to do anything meaningful).

As we move through the material there will be several times to listen to a variety of music with various assignments attached to those times. You teacher may adjust the specifics of when each of these happen, but here we will discuss all three of those main opportunities, as well as the concept of Deep Listening.

### Ear Training

As we work through Unit 1 there will be several opportunities to practice your ear training. These exercises will present you with various audio samples that play concepts we have been discussing. The goal of these assignments is to hear something and be able to identify what it is. If you don't know what a major chord sounds like, then why would you use one in your music?

Periodically links to [musicthoery.net](musicthoery.net) will appear that will take you to ear training exercises. 

### Listening Journal

It is recommended that each class meeting start with listening to some music. The specifics of this are at the discretion of the teacher. By listening to these concepts used in the real world and exploring new genres of music, you can start to develop or further identify exactly how you feel about different musical ideas and more quickly decide what you do and don't like about a song as well as how to fix those issues. Whenever a listening happens in class, students should keep a listening journal to be submitted for a grade. The journal should include some basic information, but mainly be a freeform response to what is being listened to. Be sure to include:

* The date this listening is happening
* The song title
* Who is performing in the recording?
* What year was the track released?

After those, the students should be listening to the content and responding to what they hear. What stands out to them? Do they like or dislike certain things **AND WHY DO THEY FEEL THAT WAY**? As the year goes on the teacher may guide the students to listen for specific things in the song such as form, instrumentation, use of effects, etc. A sample listening is given below:

Date: Today
Track: Miracles out of Nowhere
Artist: KANSAS
Year: 1976
To Listen for: Panning

Response: This song has a lot of moving parts. The instruments are playing constant moving lines, but the voice is always the loudest thing. At the beginning basically everything is panned center or close to it. The main vocals and backup vocals sound very similar to each other; I didn't notice they were different people at first. Panning becomes noticeable when we get to the chorus. On the words "Here" and "There" the backup vocals are hard-panned left and right in order to make those words sound like they are coming form somewhere else. This evolves as the song plays. I really enjoy this as it adds a new layer to the song without taking away anything from the soloistic nature of all the instruments. It is especially useful because of how close to center everything else is by comparison.

Songs can come from a variety of sources, genres, and artists. One recommendation is to create a class playlist to hold everything you listen to over the course of the year. It can also be fun to have students submit their favorite song to the list as an option for future listenings.

### Guided Listening Presentation

By the end of the year students should have listened to a wide variety of tracks showing a wide variety of music. As they become more practiced at listening to music and responding to what they are hearing, they will be required to give a short presentation on a track for the class. This presentation is designed to have students listen to new music, as well as show their understanding of the music through deep listening and historical research. Students may work on the presentation individually or in group of 2-3 at the discretion of the teacher. The presentation should be between 6 and 10 minutes in length, including time to listen to the entire song.

Instructions:

1. Song Selection: Use the list below in order to choose your song. No duplicate songs should be presented in each class so have a backup ready when selecting.
2. Powerpoint: Your presentation must be on either a powerpoint or google slides presentation. Relevant information, links to songs, pictures, etc. must all be on the presentation. This will be what is submitted following your presentation. Your slides should have the following sections:
    * Background information: Provide some context about the song and artist. Be sure to include:
        Who the artist is and any notable produces or talent they may have worked with in the recording process
        When the song was released and on what album (if applicable)
        Anything else related to the song that we will not hear in the music.
        Any sources that are not common knowledge (dates, names, places, etc.) MUST be cited in the final slide of the presentation. Do not use wikipedia as a source. Interview, web-articles, and social media posts by the artists are all acceptable.
        **This section should take no more than 2 minutes**
    * Listen For: A quick slide that shows a few interesting key elements of the song to listen for. Help to prepare the audience for listening to the song.
        **This section should take no more than 30 seconds**
    * 3-5 slides that provide a guide for what is happening in the music. You will be showing (and only showing, not talking about) these slides and changing from one to the next in time with the music. While it plays. 
        Slides should be concise enough for your audience to read without being distracted from the listening experience. 
        The total number of slides will vary depending on the form of the song. 
        Each slide should have a few important bullet points for that section - What changed from the last section? What should we be listening for now? What are any especially important or striking features of this section? Is there anything that strays from the primary elements that you originally told us to listen for?
        **This section will vary in length depending on the song, but should not exceed 5 minutes.**
    * Guided Discussion: Choose one single feature from the song that you would like to explore further â€“ a transition, the sound of one particular synth, some social commentary on the lyrics, etc. Lead a discussion on this topic. You should hear from a few of your classmates during this section. You can use a few short listening examples from your song during this discussion to illustrate your point - make sure you have the track times sorted out ahead of time!
        **This section should not exceed 2 minutes and 30 seconds**
3. Slides should be submitted to your teacher prior to your presentation. If the timeline guides are followed, the presentation should be exactly 10 minutes in duration. If one section is shorter, then others can be longer so long as the total time does not exceed 10 minutes.


#### Listening Presentation Track List

Use this list in order to choose a song for your presentation. Songs outside of this list may be utilized following approval by your teacher. You should include both what the song it and why you want to present it when asking about external options.

Songs are arranged alphabetically by Artist. All links are to youtube. A Spotify playlist of the list is available [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5OxyQuPevovwmrKDRTmwSH?si=b607e4f81cda4207).

### Deep Listening

The Last Listening concept we will discuss in this section is the idea of Deep Listening. Pioneered by American composer Pauline Oliveros, Deep Listening is (put simply) the idea of intentionally listening, focusing on how you are listening and responding to the sounds as much as the sound content itself, and applying that to what you are working on. In practice, it comes up as more than just hearing whatever is playing, but instead focusing on various elements to dive into the content and see what there is to gain from it. Oliveros describes the idea and practice of Deep Listening best in a 2015 TED Talk: 

?![oliveros-dl-ted-talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QHfOuRrJB8)

when listening to various songs in class, including your own projects, try and approach the experience with Deep Listening in mind. Remind yourself when you are not listening. Be aware of what you are listening to, what is present in the sound, and how it interacts with other sounds and yourself. This is not an easy thing to do any will take a lot of practicing in order to get used to. Luckily, this course has a lot of things to listen to!

## Pitch

Pitch is how musicians talk about a sound's frequency. In a performance setting where hundreds or thousands of notes are played in a few minutes, referring to a sound frequency with a small collection of names is much more practical than having to calculate what to play with numbers. Western musical pitch is represented with letter names as follows:

* A
* B
* C
* D
* E 
* F
* G

The specific notes will repeat over and over again. This loop is called an octave because the repeated note is the 8th in the sequence above the original pitch. We can refer to the specific octave with a number. "Middle C" on the music staff is C4. The C below is C3, and the one above is C5. A standard 88 key piano has the pitches A0-C8.

In terms of frequency, it doubles every octave. So C5 has a frequency twice as high as C4 and four times as high as C3. This doubling is what helps us hear the same note at different octaves.

### Flat and Sharp

We will talk more about how to read music later in this unit, but we haven't quite covered every note on a keyboard. A-G mentioned previously only account for the white keys on a piano. The black keys on a keyboard have slightly longer names. When played together, A and B sound pretty close, but an additional note can actually fit in that space (The specifics of musical intervals will be coming up soon.). To help keep these other notes related to the short list of 7 pitches, musicians simply indicate if the notes previously mentioned have been raised or lowered to the closest black key.

The phrase 'sharp' indicates a note has been made one piano key higher, while the phrase 'flat' indicates that the pitch has been lowed by one piano key.Using these new notes, an octave will have 12 equally spaced notes within it, indicated by the repeating pattern of piano keys. You mau have noticed that if you follow this process, you will have different names for the same pitch. E.G. Moving one step above C and one below D will be the same key on the keyboard. These pitches are called enharmonic. Enharmonic pitches sound the same, but the name used to refer to the pitch will change depending on the context of the music around the note. Doing this allows for the music to be easier to read and analyze. The full list of these pitches is:

* A
* A sharp/B flat
* B
* C
* C sharp/D flat
* D
* D sharp/E flat
* E
* F
* F sharp/G flat
* G
* G sharp/A flat

Notice that there is no black key between B/C and E/F. The same sharp/flat rule still applies, so B sharp is the same as C natural.

### Solfedge

The visual symbols used to refer to all of these notes will come up later, but we can still give these notes names to refer to them and sing. A system called solfedge was developed in the 11th century and used as another way to mention pitch. The original latin syllables are largely unchanged from the original:

* Do
* Re
* Mi
* Fa
* Sol
* La
* Ti

## Overtones and Timbre

When talking about various instruments, the idea of timbre will often come up. Timbre refers to how a particular sound sounds. A clarinet, guitar, trombone, and your voice all have unique timbres that let them sound different from each other, even if playing the same note.

Timbre is largely determined through the overtones present when a sound is made. An overtone is a frequency higher than the fundamental pitch that harmonically resonate with the instrument. Every sound has multiple overtones, and it is the unique volume of all these frequencies combined together which determine the timbre of an instrument.

Let's try it! Say something or have someone else say something normally. Then, repeat the original phrase covering their mouth with a piece of paper, a thicker book, one, then two hands. Each item acts like a filter, blocking more frequencies in the original sound from being as loud. You should ear that each repetition should slightly different from the previous one, despite being the same content.

## Musical Intervals

## Musical Scales

A musical scale is a collection of intervals. Starting on one note, then following the interval pattern will create a scale. Scales are useful for a variety of reasons because they contain all of the notes within a given key. The note beginning the scale is the key of that scale. following the same pattern on a different note will result in another of the same scale in a different key.  

Using a certain scale will give your music a unique character. Be sure to listen to each of the scales we go over to see which ones you like and might want to use in a project!

Throughout this book, we will use this notation in order ot represent the various intervals in a scale pattern:

* H: Half-Step
* W: Whole Step
* 2+: Augmented Second
* m3: Minor Third

### Major Scales

All major scales have the same pattern. WWHWWWH

Starting on C, the pattern is CDEFGABC. These are all of the white keys on the piano with no black keys. 
On G, the pattern is GABCDEF#G. This scale has a single black key: F#
On F, the pattern is FABbCDEF. This is the other scale with only one black key: Bb

### Minor Scales

Unlike a major scale, a minor scale has 3 different versions depending on the context of how it is used. Between all of them, the key shared feature is that the third scale degree is lowered by a half step compared to a major scale starting on the same pitch.

#### Natural Minor

When compared to a major scale, the natural minor has a lowered 3rd, 6th,and 7th scale degree. The pattern for these scales is WHWWWHWWW.

A C major scale is CDEFGABC, while a C natural Minor is CDEbGAbBbC

These scales can be used anywhere.

#### Hormonic Minor

Compared to the natural minor, the Harmonic minor scale has a raised 7th scale degree. The Pattern for this scale is WHWWH2+H.

A C natural minor scale is CDEbFGAbBbC, while a C harmonic minor scale is CDEbFGAbBC. This extra interval and half step between scale degrees 7 and 8 make this scale useful for chord-related purposes. This scale can create a dominant 7th chord (a major chord built on scale degree 5, with an additional minor 7th above the root.) while a natural minor scale cannot.

#### Melodic Minor

The melodic minor acts like a combination of the scales discussed so far, and is unique forms depending on whether it is ascending or descending. This scale is used in melodic contexts because the performer can easily change between the two forms to get the note they need without changing the key or harmonic implications of the music.

THe ascending version is identical to the major scale, but with a lowered third scale degree, while the descending version is identical to the natural minor scale.

Starting on C, the ascending version is CDEbFGABC, and the descending version is CBbAbGFEbDC. The pattern for this scale is WHWWWWH ascending, and WWHWWWH descending.

### Other Scales

in addition to the major and minor scales there are SEVERAL others. In this course, however, we will only discuss 3 of them.


#### Chromatic Scale

A chromatic scale is a scale comprised of only half steps. This means that the scale is comprised of every keyboard key within an octave. The patterns is HHHHHHHHHHH, and the scale will sound identical regardless of the starting pitch.

CC#DD#EFF#GG#AA#BC


#### Whole-Tone Scale

The Whole-Tone scale follows the same idea as the chromatic scale, only using whole steps for each interval. Because of the asymmetrical nature of the chromatic scale (lack of black keys between B/C and E/F), there are two different versions of the Whole-Tone scale; each one with a unique collection of notes.

* Version 1: CDEF#G#A#C
* Version 2: C#D#FGABC#

If needed, the version of the scale being used can be referred to by whether it has C or C#. The pattern for a Whole-Tone Scale is WWWWWW


#### Octatonic Scale

The Octatonic scale combines the two previous scale by alternating between the two intervals. Similar to the Whole-Tone scale, the Octatonic scale has different versions depending on which note you start on, as well as which pattern you use.

* Version 1: CDEbFGbAbABC
* Version 2: CDbEbFbGbGABbC
* Version 3: C#DEF#GABbC

Each of these versions account for every unique combination of pitches when alternating between half and whole-steps. The patterns are WHWHWHWH and HWHWHWHW. Version 3 is HWHWHWHW as well, but starting on C# instead of C.

## Chords & Harmony

While you generally hear notes in scales played sequentially, a chord occurs when multiple notes are played at the same time. This is different than a harmonic interval, which is two notes played simultaneously. A chord must be three or more notes performed at the same time. The specifics of the intervals between those notes and how many notes are in the chord help identify what the chord is, and how it is behaving in the music.

Generally, music progresses as a series of musical chords. This is called the chord progression. The composer will use the notes of a scale to build their chords, giving the music a feeling of identity. This is called the music's key. If a composer changes which scale they are using, then the notes in each chord will change. This can be small and add extra color to the music, or a larger key change.

When building a chord, one note is always the root, and the other notes are chosen based on their interval relation to the root. The remainder of this section will discuss the various interval patterns you can use to create various kinds of chords.

### Major Chords

A major chords is probably the most-commonly heard chord in Western music. to form this chord, You need the 1st, third, and 5th scale degrees of any major scale. All of the chords discussed in this book will be built on variations of the 3rd, and what amounts to a collection of every other note within various scales. Another way to conceptualize building a major scale is that you are playing a root note as well as the pitches a major third and perfect 5th above the root at the same time.

A C major chord has the notes CEG, G Major has GBD, and F major has FAC.

Generally, people hear major chords as happy or neutral.

In a major key you can build major chords following the every other note pattern with scale degrees 1,3,4, and 5 as the respective root notes. In minor keys this changes to scale degrees 3, 6, and 7 (when using natural minor)

### Minor Chords

Minor chords are only one half step away from their parallel major chord. Remembering that a minor scale has a lowered third scale degree, you can still take scale degrees 1,3, and 5 of a minor scale to build its chord. The intervals above the root are a minor third and a perfect fifth. The other lowered notes are still present in the scale, but not being actively used in the chords, allowing the melodic form of the minor scale to alternate between flat and natural scale degrees 6 and 7.

C minor has CEbG, G minor has GBbD, anf F minor has FAbC

Compared to major chords, minor chords tend to feel more sombre or sad.

In a major key you can build minor chords following the every other note patter using scale degrees 3 and 6. In a minor key this changes to 1, 4, 5 and 7.

### Other Chords

The major and minor chords will likely be the most common ones you come across, but there are several more. THese other ones are still common, and can add further emotion to the context of your music.

#### 7th Chords

A 7th chord contains the next note following the every other note pattern up the scale. This creates a chord with 4 pitches: the 3rd, 5th, and 7th above the root of the chord. This adds more character to the note, as well as a musical motion to move to another chord. The specific interval between the 7th and the other notes will change its type, the strength and direction of this motion, and overall sound of the chord. Here we will focus on the Dominant 7th chord. 

The dominant 7th takes a natural MAJOR 7th chord built from the 5th scale degree of the music's key and lowers the 7th by a half step. This creates a whole step interval between the root of the chord and the 7th, weakening the pull to the chord root. Instead the listener will hear the dominant 7th chord want to resolve to the home key of the music. This happens because of the half step between the chord's 3rd and 7th, and the home key's 1st and 3rd degrees respectfully.

In the key of C the dominant 7th is GBDF, G is DF#AC, and F is CEGBb. Notice that all the notes are still present in the home key. This is not the same for minor chords. This is because a dominant 7th chord is ALWAYS a major chord with the 7th added. So for C minor, the Dominant 7th would still be GBDF. This is the main reason for the use of the harmonic minor scale. Because of the raised scale degree 7, it can be used to build dominant 7th chords.

Because the dominant 7th chord is always built on scale degree 5 of the music's key, there is only one version per key.

#### Augmented Chords

An augmented chord is a symmetrical chord built on 2 major thirds. This creates a chord with a major third and augmented 5th above the root. THese chords tend to sound more open and less centered than a major chord. Depending on the voicing, the augmented 5th can sound more like a minor 6th and create a darker sound.

C augmented is CEG#, G Augmented is GBD#, and F Augmented is FAC#. You will often see augmented chords written with 'Aug' or + to indicate this type of chord.

#### Diminished Chords

A diminished chord is another symmetrical chord, but built with minor thirds instead of major ones. This creates a highly dissonant chord that can create a lot of tension within the music. 

C Dim is CEbGb, G Dim is GBbDb, and F Dim is FAbCb. You can also add the 7th to both augmented and diminished chords to create more chord variations, but we will not be discussing additional chords here.

### Chord Inversions

In the chord examples so far, they have all been built in ascending order, with the root being the lowest pitch of the chord. In music you will often find that this is not the case. In fact, many chord progressions utilize different chord tones in the bass line to help move the progression more smoothly from chord to chord. We call this inverting the chord. By changing which chord tone is the lowest pitch of the chord, different textures and sounds can be created. 

A chord in 1st inversion has the 3rd as the lowest note of the chord. These function similar to a root position chord, but are slightly less stable. They generally come up because of the notes in the bass line.

Second inversion chords have the 5th as the bass note, and are significantly more unstable than a root position chord because of the larger interval between the bass and other chord tones. These chord are often used to help with musical cadences.

A third inversion chord only happens on chords with 4 or more tones. In the context of this book, that would put the 7th as the lowest note. Because of the 7th chord's exhalent instability combines with the close interval between the 7th and 8th, these chords are heard as strongly wanting to move to the root. Although this tends to be a 1st inversion form of the root in many theory textbooks. (we will not discuss voice leading here)

## Reading Music

All of this music theory is great, but what would you do if you wanted to have someone else perform music that your created, or if you wanted to create a record of your music? To do both those things and more, a music notation was created that allows anyone reading the music to recreate the same sounds that the composer was intending when they created the music. Western music notation has a few important conventions that we will need to go over in order to understand what is happening on the page, but ultimately music notation's main goal is to tell the performer which notes to play, when to play them, and any other information they need to create the desired sound. Prior to audio recording and playback, it was the only way to share the music you created with other people!

### Rhythm

Before we start worrying about notating pitch, lets focus on the rhythm of the music. Each note on the page has an implied duration. The specific time of each note can vary depending on the tempo of the music, so the rhythm is represented using fractions and relationships that do not change. In order to determine what the rhythmic value of a note is, you must look at the shape of the note; specifically at the stem or flags that may be attached to the note head ( the note head is the round part and usually used to represent the pitch of the note).

* No stem, hollow note head : Whole Note
* Stem only, hollow note head : Half Note
* Stem only, head filled in : Quarter note
* Stem only, head filled in, 1 flag : Eighth Note
* Stem only, head filled in, 2 flags : 16th Note
* Stem Only, head filled in, 3 flags : 32nd note
* and so on.

Moving down the list, each note is half of the duration of the note that proceeded it. This is clear thought the naming as well as 1/4 is half of 1/2, and the naming convention follows the same relationship.

The image below shows a chart of the various rhythmic symbols. 


So far we have only talked about the duration of notes in music, but knowing when not to play is as important as knowing when to play. To indicate this, symbols for rests were also created. When these symbols appear in music, it means that the performer should not make any sounds. The naming convention and 2:1 ration of the notes mentioned above still apply to rests, but the symbols are slightly different.

* Downward facing rectangle : Whole Rest
* Upward facing rectangle : Half Rest
* Squiggly Line: Quarter Rest
* Tick with 1 flag : Eighth Rest
* Tick with 2 flags, 16th Rest
* and so on.

A whole rest is mainly used to indicate that no sound is occurring for the entire measure, regardless of the time signature. If 4 beats of rest are needed, it is more common to use half and quarter rests instead. The chart below shows what these symbols look like.

Lastly, if you need to indicate a note or rest duration that is not exactly half the duration of the next highest note, for example 3, 5, or 7.25 beats, dots and ties can be used. A tie is a connecting line between two notes of the same pitch, and indicates that their durations should be combined into a single note. Rest do not use ties because two rests performed back-to-back still sounds like one single rest. A dot, however, can be applied to any note or rest. A dot indicates that half the duration of the proceeding note/rest duration should be added on to the original note. For example, a dotted quarter note/rest would start with a duration of one beat (in 4/4), and then add half a beat onto it for a total duration of 1.5 beats. A whole note starts at 4 beats, then adds half of its original value to total 6 beats when a dot is added.The chart below shows dotted note values.

#### Time Signatures and Meter

The time signature is used to tell the performer how the various notes are grouped together. 4/4 is one of the most common times. This information is represented as a fraction. The upper number indicates how many beats are present within a single bar of music, while the lower value indicates which note duration is equal ot one beat. 

In the case of 4/4, the quarter note is worth one beat (x/4), adn there are 4 beats per measure. 3/4 would only have three beats per measure, 2/4 and 5/4 having 2 and 5 respectively. Having an 8 in the denominator indicates that an eighth note receives a single beat. 3/8,6/8,and 9/8 are all common times with this denominator.

Generally speaking, the numerator of the time signature fraction can be any number, while the denominators must be an even multiple of 2. 2,4,8,16,and 32 are the most commonly used denominators. The time signature will appear at the beginning of the music and whenever the time signature changes.

#### Tempo

Tempo is how fast the music is. All music will have some kind of internal clock, beat, or pulse to it, and the number of times per minute that this pulse occurs at is the tempo. If a piece of music was written in 4/4, and had a tempo of 60 B.P.M. (beats per minute), then you would count each quarter note at a rate of 1 per second. to get the full duration of the music, you can count the number of measures, multiply that by 4 (4 beats per measure in 4/4), then divide that number by 60 to get the total time (total beats / BPM). If the music was 80 measures long, then:

80 * 4 = 320
320 / 60 = 5.33333...
So the duration would be approximately 5 minutes and 20 seconds, assuming the performer stayed at exactly 60 B.P.M. and 4/4 the entire performance.

### Pitch

In addition to knowing how long to play, musicians also need to know which note to play in order to create the various chords, textures, and melodic lines of the music. This is done with the vertical placement of the notes on the staff. As you read the rhythm from right to left, higher notes on that line indicate a higher pitch to be played (and vice versa).

#### Clefs and the Musical Staff

Music is notated on a staff. This is a collection of horizontal lines that you read from left to right, and shows the various information conveys by the music. Instruments that do not make a pitch, like a drum, utilize only 1 line staves, but most instruments utilize a 5 line staff. To indicate a desired pitch, the head of the note (the round part) is placed on a specific line, or the space between two adjacent lines. Each line and space indicates a specific musical pitch. You can also think of each line/space representing a specific key on a piano keyboard. 

you may have noticed however that a piano has more keys than a 5 line staff has notes. To help with this, clefs are utilized. A clef appears at the beginning of every staff, and serves to indicate which pitches are used on that staff. There is a handful of different clefs used in music notation, but we will be focusing on the two most common: Treble and Bass.

The treble clef is used for higher pitched instruments, and the shape is shown below. On staves with the treble clef, the second-from-bottom line is specifically the pitch G4. This is the reason this is also called the G clef.

The bass clef, shown below, is used for bass instruments. Staves using this clef have the second from the top line as the pitch F3. This is why this is also referred to as the F clef.

These clefs are used together in what is called a grand-staff for instruments with a large range like the piano. This works because the pitch C4, or middle C, is located in between these two clefs, and acts as a bridge between them. Whenever a note appears outside of the boundaries of a staff, you can use ledger lines to extend the staff and accurately read the pitch. Middle C is one ledger line below the treble staff, _and_ one ledger line above the bass staff.

#### Keys and Key Signatures

Lastly for now, in regards to pitch, Music and sections of music can have a key. When a piece of music utilizes notes from a specific scale, and cadences to that same scale, then that scale is the key.
