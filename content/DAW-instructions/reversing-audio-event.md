# Reversing Audio Event
There are two ways to easily reverse the content in an Audio Event:
  1. Right-click [Ctrl+click on some Macs] on an Audio Event. In the menu that appears, hover over "Audio: Operations specific to audio events", then select "Reverse Audio".
  2. With the desired Audio Event already selected, use the key command [Cmd+R] on Mac, [Ctrl+R] on Windows.
