## Import Video
The simplest way to import a video file is to drag-and-drop it from the File Browser into the arrangement. Supported video files appear in the browser with a Film Strip icon. You can also use the Import Video menu in the Video Player to import any supported video file.

Drag a video file from the File Browser to the arrangement to import the video file to the Video Player. When doing this, note that the position to which you drag the video is used to set the offset for video playback. For instance, if you drag-and-drop a video to 10 seconds in on the timeline, the offset is set at 10 seconds, and video playback does not begin until that position is reached.

Hold [Ctrl]/[Cmd] while dragging to only extract the audio from the video and place it in the position to which you drag. Hold [Alt] while dragging to simultaneously import the video file to the Video Player and extract the audio from the video and place it on an audio Track.
