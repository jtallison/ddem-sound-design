## Audio Event Transpose and Tune
The ability to transpose and fine-tune audio adds a lot of flexibility when working with audio files. For instance, if you have a keyboard loop collection in which every loop is in the key of C, being able to transpose these loops to any other key opens up many possibilities.

In Studio One, transposing and tuning are a part of the same set of advanced algorithms as timestretching, so the quality is extremely high.

To transpose any audio Event, select it and open the Inspector by pressing [F4] on the keyboard or clicking on the Inspector button above the Track Column. Then enter a value in the Transpose field, from -24 to +24 semitones.

Tuning is similar to transposing but the pitch is changed in cents, rather than semitones. Enter a value from -100 to 100 cents in the Tune field to fine-tune the audio Event.

Any number of Events can be selected and transposed or tuned simultaneously, but note that this change is not relative to the current setting of each Event. All selected Events are transposed or tuned to the same chosen value.

The Transpose and Tune fields are also available by right-clicking [Cmd-clicking on some Macs] the desired audio Event.
