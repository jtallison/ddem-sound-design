## Cut, Copy, and Paste
As with most software applications, Studio One supports cut, copy, and paste actions. Once you have selected an Event or a range of Events, you can perform these actions:

  * **Cut** Press [Ctrl]/[Cmd]+[X] on the keyboard to cut the current selection.
  * **Copy** Press [Ctrl]/[Cmd]+[C] on the keyboard to copy the current selection.
  * **Paste** Once a selection is cut or copied, press [Ctrl]/[Cmd]+[P] on the keyboard to paste the selection. The Events are pasted on the selected Track, at the current playback cursor position. If you select and copy Events on multiple Tracks, then select another timeline location on the first Track, and then paste, the copied Events are pasted in the appropriate Tracks and locations, starting with the first (selected) Track.
  * **Paste at Original Position** If you want to copy and paste an Event from one Song into another Song (or another version of the Song), and want the Event to be placed at its original location in the timeline, copy the Event and paste by pressing [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[V].
