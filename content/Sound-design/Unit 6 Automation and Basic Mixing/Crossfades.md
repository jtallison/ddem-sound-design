Crossfades are an indispensable tool for working in any DAW. These occur when one audio event fades out while the next one fades in. You can manually create a crossfade by editing the eventâ€™s envelope flags, but there is a quicker way.

First, you need to have two audio events placed next to each other. Then select BOTH events and press the X key. You should see new flags appear on both events. You can then drag out the crossfades to the exact duration and speeds desired just like working with the envelope flags.

Crossfades are useful for combining audio because it can be extremely noticeable when two clips play back to back. This is due to both the audible silence between the clips, as well as a low-level click that can occur when moving from the silence to the second clip. To avoid this, add a crossfade whenever you have two audio clips playing back-to-back.
