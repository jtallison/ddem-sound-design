When arranging sounds, you can control whether they come out of the left speaker, right speaker, or somewhere in between. This control is called panning, and there are two main ways to control this in Studio One.

The first is to statically set the panning value for a track. To do this, click the “Mix” button in the bottom right to open the mix window. This window is used for managing various plugins, audio routing, and balances in a project. (full tour later) Underneath the small windows showing the track’s audio source and destination routing is a blue bar. This bar is what controls the panning. Dragging this to the left will make the sound come from the left audio channel and vise versa. You can set this specifically by double clicking on the number beneath this bar and entering the desired pan value. Now, all audio on this track will follow the panning set here.

But what if you want to have the panning change during the source of the project? To do that we need to look at the automation. To open this, select the automation button in the top-left section of the screen, and select the dropdown menu (defaults to “Display: Off”) and select panning. If you do not see panning as an option, see the lesson on automation for further steps.

The bar that appears on the track represents the panning over the course of the project. Double click to add a point to the line. These points can then be moved to set a specific value at a specific time. Up pans left and down pans right. Utilizing this method of panning can allow you to move a sound source around while it is playing, which can add a lot of texture to your project without having to alter the sound content itself.

To hide the automation, click the automation button again.
