One commonly used effect is reversing an audio file. This will cause the computer to read through the file from end to start instead of start to end. You can hear this in several songs as a unique texture.

To reverse an audio event in Studio One 6 is quick and easy. Select the audio event you wish to reverse, and then right click. Under Audio Options or the Action menu, you will see the option to reverse the audio. This can also be done with CTRL/CMD + R on the keyboard. Once reversed you will see the waveform update accordingly in the main Studio One window.
