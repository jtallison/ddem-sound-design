# Unit 3: Working with Studio One 6

This unit serves as our introduction to Studio One 6. We will start by making sure the software is installed on your device and then go on a tour of the main software windows. By the end of the unit we will be able to add and manipulate those sounds in order to create a few projects right away!


 


## Installing and Authorizing Studio One 6

Before we can begin making sounds in Studio One, you first need to have the software installed on your computer. If you are doing this as part of a class at school, then don’t worry. The school will install the software for you. However if you would like to have Studio One on your personal device, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Get a license from Presonus. 
    In order to utilize Studio One, you will need to have a license. Presonus offers a free version called Studio One Prime, an intermediate version called Studio One Artist, and a full version called Studio One Professional. Keep in mind that the free and intermediate versions do not have all of the features present in Studio One Professional. Presonus also offers a subscription service called Studio One +. Check out the [Presonus website]( https://www.presonus.com/en-US/studio-one-compare.html) to decide which version is right for you! (If you are unsure, start with Studio One Prime and then you can upgrade at a later date!)

2. Install and Authorize Studio One. 
    Once you have acquired a license for Studio One, you can go ahead and install the software. To get to the download page, log in to your Presonus account (needed to acquire a license) and navigate to the products page. Click on your Studio One license and download the installer for your operating system. Follow the installation directions in the wizard. Once installed, open Studio One and enter your Presonus login info to authorize the software and install any additional plugins you may have bought.

For more information on installing and authorizing Studio One 6 on your device, check out the [Studio One online manual](https://s1manual.presonus.com/StudioOneReferenceManual.htm#Getting_Started_Topics/Chapter-Installation_and_Activation.htm?TocPath=_____2).

If you will be using a Presonus audio interface or MIDI controller, I recommend installing [Presonus Universal Control](https://legacy.presonus.com/products/Universal-Control). This software helps to update drivers and interface with various device settings. If you will not be using presonus equipment, then you should make sure you have the up-to-date drivers for whichever divice you will be using.

 

 

## Navigating Studio One 6

At the time of writing, Studio One 6.2 is the most up-to-date version of Studio One. When opening Studio One, a window will appear showing the various setup processes. For the most part you can ignore this. If the setup needs your input, or runs into any issues it will appear here for you to respond to. Once ready, the main Studio One window will appear. This window has three main sections:

* The leftmost section of the window is used for opening and creating new sessions. You will see previous sessions that can be opened listed here and can filter them by type. You can also open a new session (either blank or from a variety of templates), open a file from the computer’s file browser, or join a project for online collaboration. The middle section of the opening window shows two main items. The first is your profile information. This can be filled out or ignored, but information here can be filled into the meta-data for exported audio and video files. The second portion of this area shows important setup information. The audio setup can be changed to a different audio interfaces and drivers, the sample rate, buffer size, and other settings can also be accessed here. The final section of the opening window shows social media posts from Presonus. Updates to the software, instructional videos, and other projects will automatically appear here.
    Check out the [Studio One 6 online manual](https://s1manual.presonus.com/StudioOneReferenceManual.htm#Pages_Topics/Start.htm?TocPath=Pages%257C_____1) for more information on the start page.

Let’s make a new Studio One Song Session. To do this, click on the + icon and select the default template (labeled “Record and Mix”). You can choose a name and location for your project to be saved with. It is HIGHLY recommended to give your projects an identifying name so that you can find it. Studio One will create a default name, but these become hard to manage, especially when utilizing Studio One on a school computer. Click open to see a new window with 5 sections. Check out the [Studio One 6 online manual](https://s1manual.presonus.com/StudioOneReferenceManual.htm#Setup_Topics/Creating_a_New_Song.htm?TocPath=Setup%257C_____6) for more information on making a new song.

* The largest part of the screen is shown in the middle. This is where your audio and MIDI clips will live. Moving them vertically will change which track the clips are located on, and moving them horizontally will change their timing location. The time can be seen in the timeline at the top of this section.
* The left side of the screen shows the various channels present in your session. As you add more and rearrange your tracks, they will appear here. You can also control the volume, mute, solo, monitoring, and input for these tracks from here as well. At the top of this section are the controls to toggle various other toolbars that all appear above the middle section.
* The right-most section of the screen is devoted to the browse window. This can be hidden by clicking the button labeled “Browse” in the bottom right of the screen. This window is used for navigating through a variety of items. Plugins, synthesizers, presets, audio files, loops, and more can all be found here and dragged-and-dropped into the session wherever is needed.
* At the bottom of the Studio One window is a toolbar containing a large amount of useful items. As a whole, this toolbar is called the Transport Bar. Moving from left to right on the Transport Bar, first is recording information such as MIDI data transfer, CPU usage, total recording time available. Next is playback information. This includes the current playhead position, playback controls (forward, refined, record, play, loop, etc.), and the markers for the left and right ends of any looped sections. The ext sections contains information on timing and can be used to set up the internal metronome or subdivisions of the timeline. The final section shows the playback volume, and can be used to adjust the output level for the whole .song project. Lastly, just to the right of the transport bar are three buttons. “Browse” toggles the browse window, “Mix” opens the mixing console window, and “Edit” opens a window used for editing either audio or MIDI files. (more on these later)
* The top-most section of the Studio One window contains several editing tools. Moving from left to right, first is the MIDI assignment window. If using a MIDI controller, various parameters can be mapped here. The next section has a variety of tools that can be utilized with the mouse. These include the main, context-sensitive tool for moving and trimming various clips, drawing lines, and splitting clips. The next section has more complex tools that have mini toolbars. These include quantization, macro controls, and removal of silence. Next are the controls for the timeline. The display and subdivisions can all be selected here. This is followed by a few miscellaneous tools such as how the screen follows the project content when playing back, opening the video window, and the help window. Last, the three icons on the right of the screen allow you to see if any downloads are happening, return to the main window, and jump to any open sessions respectively.

By right-clicking on the top toolbar you can open a customize window that will add (or remove) elements from the tool bar, allowing you to customize the layout. If you are new to working with Studio One, I recommend leaving it as the default layout until you are familiar enough to make changes.

Check out the [Studio One 6 online manual](https://s1manual.presonus.com/StudioOneReferenceManual.htm#Pages_Topics/Song.htm?TocPath=Pages%257C_____2) or these videos for more informaition on the Song page and transport bar:

## Adding Sound Files

Adding content to a Studio One session is simple. The first thing you need is an audio file. We will go over how to record in Studio One, but for now let’s use these pre-recorded files. 

There are several ways to import a file into Studio One 6. The first is to utilize the browse window to find the file you want. This is useful, but it can be difficult to navigate through a large number of folders. We will instead utilize this method for plugins and synthesizers. Studio One is created to utilize a drag-and-drop for adding content. This is extremely useful as you can open the computer’s file browser, select multiple files, and drag them into the session all at once. When adding these files, if no track is available, one will be automatically created, and the type of track will depend on the file being selected.

More information on Studio One 6's drag-and-drop functionality can be found in the [Studio One online manual](https://s1manual.presonus.com/StudioOneReferenceManual.htm#Fundamentals_Topics/Drag_and_Drop.htm?TocPath=Fundamentals%257C_____8).


There are several different kinds of tracks. These can be created via the track menu at the top of the screen, or more quickly through the + icon in the top-left section of the screen. 
Audio tracks are for audio files. You can select the track’s input, whether it is stereo or mono, and a few other settings.
Instrument tracks are for software plugin instruments. These can be selected here or later from the Browse menu.
Automation tracks only include automation information for a specific track. These will likely be the least-used tracks in this class since automation can be applied directly onto an Audio or Instrument track.
Folder tracks are used for grouping together multiple other tracks. For example, in a larger mix, you could group together all of the microphones used on the drumset into a larger folder, or create a folder for the various vocal tracks. Effects and automations applied to the folder tracks are applied to everything within the folder.
When making a track, you can give the tracks a name, choose a preset for the track, adjust the track color, and how many copies of the track that you wish to make.

 

 

## The Grid

The grid is a useful tool for arranging your audio and MIDI events in time. You can see the grid as a series of ticks throughout the arrange window. By default the grid shows the Bars layout, which will show musical bars and beats to measure time. By using this tool it is much easier to line up various elements visually on the screen. The resolution of the grid will adapt to how zoomed in you are. Being zoomed out will only show bars or beats, while being zoomed in can show 16th notes.

By default events will snap to the grid. This means that when you move an event, it will automatically line up the beginning of the event to the closest Grid tick whenever you release your mouse button. This is useful, but not for every kind of music. If you want to turn this off, you can click this button in the top toolbar (or press the F hotkey) in order to toggle this. When snap-to-grid is off you can freely move events without them automatically aligning to the Grid.

For more information on Grid Snap, check out this video from Presonus as well as the [online Studio One 6 manual](https://s1manual.presonus.com/#Editing_Topics/The_Grid.htm?TocPath=Editing%257C_____4/).

## Saving and Backing Up Projects

Most DAW’s function by locating audio files saved on the computer, and then using various algorithms, analyzes the file contents and creates a new file based on the user’s inputs. In order to do this, the DAW needs to remember exactly where source files are saved, how to edit those files, and more. In most cases when you save a DAW session, the resulting file is not a copy of everything in the session, but rather is a set of instructions for how the DAW can locate the necessary files to build the session the next time it is opened. This is exactly what is happening when Studio One 6 creates a new .song file whenever your session is saved. 

It is important to realize this distinction about the DAW save files: They are NOT audio files. A person cannot take the save file and listen to it like they could a .mp3 or .wav file. They must have the appropriate DAW for that file type and any other necessary files in order to build the session. If I were to create a mix on my computer in Studio One, and then share only the .song file with a friend, they would be unable to do anything with it because their computer would not have the same files saved in the same places, or the same plugins as my computer would. This is super annoying and problematic, so how does Studio One get around this?

Some DAWs will automatically package everything into the save file so the session can be opened in any instance of the DAW, but this can result in problematically large file sizes. Studio One users can share their sessions in a few different ways. One is to export the mixdown of your session. This will take all of the audio, render it with effects, and create a stereo audio file such as a .mp3 or .wav that can be played on most devices. These files can be easily shared, but not separated and edited in a DAW. 

To hare a DAW session with someone (who is not an online collaborator), You will need to share all of the necessary files. These are located within the project folder. When saving the session for the first time, Studio One will make a folder that contains everything for that project. This includes: .song files, mixdowns, stems, backups, and copies of the source files. To share, in Studio One, go to File > Save to new Folder to copy everything into a new folder that you can then easily put on a flash drive or zip up to send via email with someone else. Remember that you have now made a copy of the original session so any changes made on one file will NOT sync with the other.

Some teachers may want you to copy the project folder for project submissions while others may just want the mixdown. Be sure to communicate with your teacher about exactly which format they are looking for.

Saving to a new folder is a great way to back up your projects, especially since the folder includes any mixdowns you've made as well. It is a good practice to back up projects as you are working on them. That way if something happens and you lose the file, you can recover a portion of your work, or can easily document and share the finished product. It is recommended for the students to have access to a drive of some kind to backup projects. This could take the form of a flash drive or SD card that the student uses, a larger class drive that everyone saves to, or online cloud storage. But no matter what it looks like, the projects should be backed up!

Check out the [Studio One 6 online manual](https://s1manual.presonus.com/StudioOneReferenceManual.htm#Saving,%20Import%20and%20Export/Saving%20Options.htm?TocPath=Saving%252C%2520Import%2520and%2520Export%257C_____5) for more information on ways to save and back up your projects!

 

 

## Arrow, Split, and Erase Tools

The Arrow Tool is the main tool that you will be using in Studio One 6. It is selected by default, and can be easily reselected by pressing the 1 key on your number bar. The Arrow Tool is context sensitive, meaning that it will do different thing depending where on the event you are clicking.

Moving/selecting events: When the mouse is located on the TOP half of an event, you can click to move the event around the main work area. The mouse will look like a standard pointer cursor to help indicate this. Moving an even left or right will change its location in time, while moving it vertically will change which track it is on. Dragging an event past the last track in your session will place it on a new track. When in this mode, you can also click on an event to select it in its entirety. This is useful when wanting to apply a process to only a few specific clips, or if you want to move an entire clip to a new location.

Selecting portions of events: When selecting the bottom half of an event, the cursor will change to a crosshair icon. When this icon is present, you can click and drag to select a portion of an event. Once selected, whichever operation you perform next will be applied to ONLY the selected portion. This includes moving the event, so be sure you have everything you want or you may accidentally slice your event in a place you don’t want to!

Trimming events: When selecting the ends of an event, the cursor will change to be a horizontal arrowhead and a line. This indicates that you can click to trim whichever end of the event your mouse is located on. Simply click and drag to remove any unwanted things at the end of a recorded file! You can also click and drag the event to be longer. This is useful when working with MIDI, but remember that you cannot extend an audio file past its original length!

Audio Envelopes: You can also adjust the audio envelopes for your files using the Arrow Tool. Simply select an audio event, and you will see three flags appear on the top of the event. The triangle-shaped flags can be dragged out towards the center of the event to create a fade in or fade out, and the maximum volume of the clip can be adjusted by dragging the square-shaped flag up or down. If you want, you can also adjust the speed of the fades with the new flag that will appear when you implement a fade.

The Split Tool is useful for splitting an event wherever you click. You can access this tool by selecting the razer blade icon or presing 3 on your number bar. When using this tool, any events you click on will be split into two separate events at the mouse’s location. If you want to delete a part of an event, you can use the Split Tool to separate the undesired portion, and then delete it by either selecting it and deleting it with the backspace key, or using the erase tool and clicking on the event. The erase tool will delete whichever event you click on when used. 

For more information on the mouse tools in Studio One 6, check out the [online manual](https://s1manual.presonus.com/StudioOneReferenceManual.htm#Editing_Topics/Arrange_View_Mouse_Tools.htm?TocPath=Editing%257C_____2) as well as this video from Presonus:

## Exporting Mixdowns

When working in Studio One, or any other DAW for that matter, the project file is NOT what you need to export for other people to be able to listen to your work. The project file is only a text file full of instructions for Studio One to be able to locate the necessary files and build the session; it does not have anything needed to actually playback the audio. Unless your teacher or someone else is specifically requesting a .song file, you should never send these out. Not because it is problematic, but because you will inevitably have to send the correct file before anything can be done with it.

In order to export the correct files so that people can listen to your project, you need to use the export window. This can be accessed with the “CMD/CTRL + E” shortcut, or from the song menu at the top of the screen. This opens the Export Mixdown window. A mixdown takes all of the various tracks in your project and renders them as a stereo audio file that can be listened to on a variety of devices. In this window you will first want to give your mixdown a name so that you can find it later. The default name of ‘mixdown’ is not helpful for this. You can also choose a specific place for the files to save to if you would like.

Next you will need to select the format for the file you wish to export. You can select multiple varieties and adjust their settings depending on what you need. For this course, sticking to .mp3 and .wav files are recommended. Both are highly compatible with most devices, and are easy enough to work with. .mp3 files are useful for smaller-scale projects as they do not require as much space, whereas .wav files are uncompressed, so they have higher degree of fidelity. I recommend saving the .wav file formatting for larger projects and final mixes, but be sure to follow your teacher’s instructions. 

Once you have selected the formatting, you must then choose exactly what portions of your project you wish to export. The timeline markers and loop bar are used for this. I recommend utilizing the loop bar as you can quickly see and adjust the portion of the project you wish to export from the main screen. I also recommend adjusting this BEFORE you open the Export Mixdown window, as you will have to close this window to adjust the bar and re-open it to continue the export. Once the loop bar has been used to highlight the content you wish to export, be sure to select the option “between loop”. Regardless of the selection method you choose, be sure to look at the duration window to make sure the exported audio matches with what you expect. Otherwise you may have large sections of unwanted silence or accidentally cut off a portion of your project.

From there you can adjust loudness if you do not plan to do any audio mastering, and adjust a few more settings. For the purposes of this class, you generally won’t need to worry about these sections. Click OK to export the audio. When done, Studio One will open a file browser window showing the file you just created so that you can easily open it or send it wherever you need to.

If the audio you exported was too loud and resulted in clipping, a warning dialogue box will pop up. This window informs you that clipping has occurred, and by how much. Clipping is not desired, so Studio One will ask if you would like to delete the file to try again. Selecting Yes here will delete the file and return you to the main project page. Selecting No will keep the clipping file. The best way to avoid clipping is to make sure nothing is too loud throughout the mix. Here I will mention two “quick and dirty” ways to remove clipping, but ideally you should be going through the mix to identify and remedy the problem. 

The first method is to lower the main output’s volume slider. This will lower the volume of everything, preserving the balance between the various elements. I recommend starting with smaller increments, usually around the amount indicated in the clipping warning window. The second method is my preferred quick way of removing clipping. To do this, simply add a limiter to the post section of your main output channel in the mix window, and set the limiter to the “0dB limiting” preset. This will keep the audio volume from passing 0dB, and eliminate clipping.

Check out the [Studio One 6 online manual](https://s1manual.presonus.com/StudioOneReferenceManual.htm#Mixing_Topics/Mixing_Down.htm?TocPath=Mixing%257C_____14) for more inforation on exporting mixdowns of your projects.

* Do not adjust loudness.
* Make sure to export the Main output.
* Be sure that the duration of the resulting audio file matches what you expect. You should between 30 and 90 seconds of audio.
* Be sure to follow your teacher’s guidelines for file submission

 

 

## Playback and Looping

Studio One is a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). DAWs allow you to be able to arrange and edit various sound sources into a single file that can be played back on various other devices. To do this, it is helpful to be able to replay what you have been working on in order to make changes. Studio One does this with the transport bar at the bottom of the main window. Here you can see useful information such as where the playhead currently is (both in seconds and in musical bars) You can toggle the playback with the play and stop buttons, as well as move the playhead by various amounts and return it to the beginning of the song with the various arrow buttons. When playing, Studio One will render each channel as audio and send it through the Main Output to whichever speakers you have connected to your computer. If you press play and can’t hear anything, make sure you are not muted, then make sure you have the correct output selected from the main page. (click home then “Configure Audio Device”.)

You can also trigger recording from the transport bar as well. When you click the record button, all armed tracks (little record button on the track) will begin recording their inputs, so make sure to check what things are armed before you record so that you don’t overwrite anything important!

When playing back audio, you will likely focus on smaller sections of the larger project. In order to avoid a headache with managing the playhead, Studio One has a handy loop feature. You can activate the loop by clicking the loop button in the transport bar. You will then see a small triangle turn blue at the beginning of the timeline above your tracks. You can click and drag this to select a portion of your song. You will see the triangle turn into a bar and the background of the main window will darken to indicate it is within the looping area of the project. You can toggle the loop on and off, and the marker will remain in the last place you set it.

Both the beginning and end of this marker are movable so you can arrange this bar to fit wherever you need. You can also enter the left and right location of the loop bar using the bar numbers to the right of the loop button. When looping is active the playhead will automatically jump to the beginning of the loop marker whenever it reaches the end.

Whenever exporting a mixdown it is important to select exactly how much audio you wish to export. The default option for selecting this is to utilize the loop marker’s positions. When exporting, it is easiest to adjust the loop bar to encompass the entire project prior to beginning the export process. That way you can export everything at once without having to go back and adjust the loop marker or the section flags. The looping does not need to be active when exporting the mixdown, but having it highlighted may be easier to visually line everything up.

This video overviews key features of the transport bar:

!?[transport-bar-video](https://youtu.be/0-QpNX7xDjE)

More information on the transport controls can be found in the [Studio One 6 online manual](https://s1manual.presonus.com/StudioOneReferenceManual.htm#Fundamentals_Topics/Transport_Controls.htm?TocPath=Fundamentals%257C_____9). 

 

 

## Macros

A macro command is a (potentially) complex series of actions for the computer to execute that can be easily triggered with a single click or button press.

Macros are a wonderful tool for quickly and easily doing a variety of actions in Studio One. You can access the Macro menu by clicking the Macro key in the top toolbar. By default there are a large number of macros already created by Presonus, but you can make your own depending on your specific workflow.

The preset macros are all broken up by category, which can be changed via the dropdown menu in the Macro panel. For this class, some of the most useful macros are the pitch macros, music creation, and the explore macros. 

To create your own macros, follow this tutorial created by Presonus.

Information on Macros and the Studio One toolbar can be [found in the online manual](https://s1manual.presonus.com/#Editing_Topics/Macro_Toolbar.htm?TocPath=Editing%257C_____23). 

 

 

## Track Names and Icons

Being able to identify your tracks is super important in any recording situation whether you are making a simple MIDI guitar solo or running a full-band studio session. In Studio One 6, you can utilize track names, colors, and icons to be able to easily identify your tracks.

Track names: When making a track you have the option to name your track right there. However if you want to change this later, you can double click on the track name on either the main screen or in the mixing console. Just double click and type the new name. As tempting as it may be to give the tracks fun names, naming a track what is recorded on it is common-practice. This makes it immediately clear which track is the lead guitar versus the two backing tracks, or which specific drum microphone you are looking at.

Colors: Each track can have a unique color assigned to it. This will cause both the events on that track, as well as any highlights to appear as that color. Studio One will add default colors to tracks as you add them so no tracks will have the same color (until Studio One runs out of color options). To change the color, right click on the color rectangle on the left-most portion of the channel list and you will see a palette of color options appear. Click on the one you want for that track to set it. If there is not a specific color you want, click on the arrow and you can utilize a variety of methods to select from over 65 million color options. 

When setting track colors, I usually give each section a color. Such as the drums are red, the bass is pink, the vocals are blue, etc. If each part is distinct enough I will give them slightly different shades of the color to help them stand out. I will also do the same thing where a folder is a base color and the contents are all slight variations.

Track Icons: Lastly in Studio One 6 you can implement icons to visually identify each channel on the mixing console. This is useful for the same reason as colors, but is less open to interpretation. In order to turn this feature on you must open the mixing console using the button in the bottom right of the screen. Then click on the wrench icon (in the mix window) and find the option called Channel Icons and check the box. You will see a new region of each channel appear above the channel name. Select the track then click on this new area to open the list of icons.

Unfortunately, you are unable to load your own icons into Studio One, but you can easily choose from the large list here by clicking on the icon. The reset button will remove the current icon. There should be enough variations in icons for you to be able to easily identify each track, especially when combined with colors and names.

 

 

## Color Customization

Studio One 6 is incredibly customizable. One of the easiest things to customize are the colors of the software. This has no effect on the functionality or capabilities of Studio One 6, but can make the software feel like your own.

To change the color scheme, open Studio One, then in the menu bar click Studio One > Preferences. In the window that pops up, click on General > Appearance. This window will allow you to adjust a wide variety of color options. These include the base color for the Studio One windows, brightness, saturation, etc. You can also decide if plugins and the music score view appear in light or dark mode.

If you would like to adjust the colors but don’t know where to begin, click on Load Preset to choose from a variety of preset color schemes, or to return Studio One 6 to the default. You can also save an arrangement as a preset by clicking Store Preset. The majority of screenshots taken on this web site utilize the dark green Acid Night preset instead of the default gray color.

For more information on changing the colors in Studio One 6, [check out the online manual](https://s1manual.presonus.com/#Setup_Topics/Custom_Colors.htm?TocPath=Setup%257C_____8)!

2. Open your DAW, create a new song/project with the title “YourFirstNameYourLastName-Lab1”. Use the following settings:
    * Sample Rate: 44,100 Hz
* Bit Depth: 16 Bits
* Tempo: 120 BPM
3. Drag one or multiple loop(s) onto new separate tracks in the arrange window.
4. Using only the basic editing/splicing techniques - copying, reversing, and speed/pitch manipulations - create 2 different variations of the original loops, each on their own tracks, each at least 2 bars/measures in length. You may end up using more than 2 tracks in your project as you move Events around and audition different parts and clips. Name the tracks of the variations “Variation 1” and “Variation 2” so that it is clear which ones are finished.
5. Ensure that all of your edits are snapped to the grid. When grid snapping is on, by default, regions and edits will snap to rhythmic divisions as you drag in the arrange window. To temporarily disable this behavior – e.g. if you need to make a tighter edit on an individual audio region – hold the shift key while dragging. If you notice the opposite behavior - that snapping only occurs while holding shift – simply press the N key to re-enable Snap to Grid.
6. When you are finished, follow the mixdown requirements to create a file that can be listened to by the teacher.
7. As always, save a backup copy on your personal storage media. This can be a flash drive, SD card, or online cloud storage. Be sure to backup both the session AND the exported audio.

Mixdown requirements:

* File name: YourFirstNameYourLastName-Lab1.
* Format: Wave or MP3 at 44.1kHz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution (128 kbps for MP3 files).
* Do not adjust loudness.
* Make sure to export the Main output.
* Be sure that the duration of the resulting audio file matches what you expect. You should have the variations play one after another in a SINGLE audio file with no gaps or pauses between the variations.
* Be sure to follow your teacher’s guidelines for file submission.
