When working in Studio One you can generally edit sounds in two main ways: changing the content of the original file and using effects to change how the file is read by the computer. Here we will be focusing on the first of those options. 

When in the main workflow of Studio One, you can right click on an event and see a variety of options. At the bottom of the menu will be three categories: Event, Audio, and Instrument Parts. Musical Functions will appear instead of Audio when selecting an instrument track, but there will always be three options. Hovering over the category will bring up a sub-menu with the various options available. If an option is not selectable, then you are unable to perform that action. Generally this can be remedied by selecting the specific elements you need to apply that action to.

Event: These are general actions that can be applied to anyevent in Studio One. These include items such as moving events, muting, combining, cropping, and rendering the event.
Audio: These are actions that will directly alter the audio present in an event. Audio Event actions include creating crossfades, detecting chords, normalizing audio, reversing audio, and stripping silence.
Instrument Parts: Lets you create new instrument parts and note patterns, render detected chords, and more
Musical Functions are applied to MIDI notes and are used for creating musical content from the notes. These functions include transposing, extending, and repeating notes, combining events, fitting notes to scales, etc.

When working in the Edit Window, you can also access the relevant options through the Action menu.
