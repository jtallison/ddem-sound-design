* Download one of these three .zip files. Depending on your teachers instructions, time allotted for this assignment, skill level, etc. an easy, normal, and expert difficulty level for this assignment is given. Be sure to follow your teacher’s instructions when picking the project difficulty.
    All of these projects come from https://www.cambridge-mt.com/ms/mtk/, which is a repository for various artists to share audio stems for other people to remix. It i important to know that the artist still owns the song and we are only allowed to remix it for educational purposes. You are not allowed to make money off of the remix from streaming.

        9 tracks.
        Dual vocals, guitar, piano, cello.
    “NORMAL” difficulty: “I’m Alright’ by Angels in the Amplifier. Acoustic rock with a heavy Latin influence.

* Once you have selected your song, extract the contents from the .zip folder. You should have a collection of audio files in a folder.
* Open a new Studio One session and import all of the files from your newly extracted folder. Make sure all of the files begin at the same time (0:00) on the timeline.
* Create your own remix of the song.
    Start with basic things. Volume, panning etc.
    Move into more in depth processing of the sounds: EQ, compression, etc.
    Add effects as desired: reverb, distortion, delay, etc.
    Automate parameters as needed. 
* When you are happy with your final mix open a text editor of your choice (google docs, word, etc.) and write out what you did in your mix. You don’t need to walk us through every minute detail, but be sure to include the following:
    Which song you worked with.
    Any inspiration or style you were trying to emulate.
    Any of the original tracks, or portions of tracks you omitted and why.
    Any unique or noticeable volume, panning, EQ, or automation work you did.
    Any noticeable effects that you implemented.
    Anything else you think we should know.
* When you are done, export the mixdown and submit both the audio file AND the text document to your teacher.
