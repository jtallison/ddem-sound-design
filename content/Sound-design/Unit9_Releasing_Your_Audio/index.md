# Unit 9: Releasing Your Audio

This unit will discuss both copyright concerns as well as the mastering process so that you can potentially release music that your create online in the future. Following the copyright discussion we will explore the Studio One 6 Project page as well as how to utilize it for mastering for a release on common online streaming platforms such as Spotify, Youtube, and SoundCloud.

## Your Music & Copyright

We have not brought up copyright in this class so far because generally what we make is allowed under the educational use clause. However, there are some important things to bring up if you want to release your audio to the wider public.

The person who makes the original music is the owner. If released by a publishing company, then the publisher is usually the owner of the track. If you utilize any content that was not created by you, it is important to properly credit the original artist. If you don't do this, you may be asked to take down the song, have a copyright strike, or be sued by the owner. Best to avoid that and only post original, licensed, or public domain content.

The opposite of this is also true. Anything you create is your intellectual property and cannot be used for monetary gain without your approval. Some platforms like YouTube will automatically check if something violates copyright, but if you come across an unauthorized use of your original content, don't hesitate to claim that to the platform.

In these short videos by the Berklee College of Music, copyright and audio sampling is wonderfully broken down and explained:

## Studio One 6 Project Page

For 99% of this course we have been using the Studio One Song editor view. This is used for creating various elements in a new mix and recording audio/MIDI. But what about when the song is done and you need to release it? That is when the Project view comes into play. Start by opening Studio One and making a new session. Except this time instead of clicking "Record and Mix" click on "Master and Release" to open the Project page. Here you can drag ang drop Mixdowns into the timeline at the bottom of the screen. If your have a .song file from a previous mix you can also load that here instead of the /mp3 or .wav. This is useful because if you make any changes to the mix, they will update in the master without you having to re-export a new file.

Notice that the timeline at the bottom is set for 80 minutes by default. This is because the length of a standard audio CD is 80 minutes. So if yous Mastering session fits on the timeline it can all be burned to a single audio CD if desired. You can see how close to full you are with the bar on the top of the window. In the top left of the screen you will see information for whichever track you select from the timeline. Clicking the small arrow next to the track name will open a dropdown menu to adjust the metadata about the track. In between the track information panel and the CD fill % are the export options. We will discuss that later.

In the middle of the screen is where information about the song will display. This is mainly loudness information. The large window in the middle of the screen will function as the Loudness Meter plug-in, showing the volume of various frequency bands. The display of this information can be adjusted per your preferences. An instance of the Phase MEter plugin is also available here as well.

## Basic Audio Mastering Concepts

So what is Audio Mastering?

Generally it is used to set the loudness of a track so that it can be easily heard and a few small adjustments to make an album or EP flow better and sound as good as possible on the final playback medium.

### Adjusting Loudness

One important aspect of Mastering is loudness and the loudness wars. As audio technology continued to evolved, audio was able to be played back at louder volumes. When audio became digital, this ceiling was greatly increased. During this time, many songs were made louder and louder, which didn't do anything to help improve the quality of the music and made it difficult to play multiple songs in a row without having to adjust the volume between each one. To help combat this, many streaming platforms implements an average loudness cap and will forcefully limit any tracks that exceed this.
