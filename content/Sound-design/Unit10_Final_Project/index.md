# Unit 10: Final Project

You've done it! Congratulations! 

There is no more new course content after this point. To show off everything that you have learned over this course, we will be moving onto the final project: a completely original musical work created by you!

As you work on the project, outlined below, feel free to refer back to any of the previous units as well as the Resources section for any refreshers and be prepared to show off your project to the class!

## Final Project Objectives

For your final project, you will compose a 3:00-5:00 original piece to be presented at the end-of-semester concert on Wednesday April 25. This project will be based in some manner on an original field recording – e.g. something you recorded in a coffee shop, while walking around campus, or an interesting collection of sounds from your kitchen. Otherwise, the form and genre of the project is completely up to you, it only needs to meet the guidelines listed below.

## Final Project Proposal

Before work can begin on your project, you must first submit a proposal for your teacher to approve. The formatting of this is at the discretion of the teacher, but the following questions should be answered:

* What kind of sounds does the student want to create?
* What inspirations does the student have for the project? (at least 1 musical and 1 non-musical)
* What field recording does the student want to use? (can be a file, or a description of the desired sound)
* What is the overall plan for the project? (give a brief summary of what will happen once you press play on the final file)

Keep in mind that the answers to these questions can change while working on the project. You don't have to confine yourself to one idea if a better one comes along. Be sure to refer back to the proposal as a sort of checklist or design document about your project. Additionally, there is one more concern that needs to be addressed by the teacher:

* Is the proposed project appropriate for public presentation?

The specifics of this will vary from school to school, but all of the presentation options of the final project will have the music played in front of a crowd. While we do not want to stifle any creativity, it is important that the project remain appropriate for whomever will be hearing it. A general guideline is to keep it PG, and be sure to listen to any comments from your teacher.


## Final Project Instructions

A rough-draft at least 1:00 in length that demonstrates the main ideas of your project must be submitted for in-class peer evaluation. At minimum, this should include an edited high-quality version of your intended field recording, and an explanation of your plans for the remainder of the project. The specific due date for the work in progress is up to the teacher, but ideally should happen around 1/4 of the way into the total in-class work time for the project. (_Teachers may ask for additional works in progress, in order to create more backups, give more feedback, and monitor progress._)

The final draft of your project must adhere to the following guidelines:

* All work MUST be done in Studio One.
* Use of “canned” loops (pre-made loops in Studio One or other commercial products) is prohibited.
* Your project must include at least one track containing audio that demonstrates some of the concepts and editing techniques from the musique concrète tradition (splicing, speed manipulation, pitch shifting, sampling, etc).
* Your project must include at least one track utilizing a built-in Studio One synthesizer instrument.
* Your project must include at least one instance each of mixer automation (volume and/or pan) and instrument automation (filter cutoff, LFO frequency, etc).
* Your project should be well-mixed (good balance between tracks, stereo spatialization) and use effects appropriately (EQ, compression, reverb). There is no minimum guideline for this category, but students that clearly put thought and attention into the balance, spatialization, and timbral qualities of their piece will earn more points.
* All MIDI must be well-edited and/or quantized as applicable.
* Your project must feature your original field recording in a significant way.
* For the final draft submission, you will need to submit your song project folder in addition to the mixdown. See the Mixdown requirements for the full submission instructions.
* When you are finished, ensure that your project has the name “YourFirstNameYourLastName-FinalProject” and submit using your teacher's instructions. Make sure that both the Mixdown file and any other files are stored inside your song project folder before submitting.
* As always, save a backup copy on your personal storage media.
* Be sure to complete the write up (more info later in the unit) and submit that as part of your project.

## Mixdown Requirements

When you are finished with your project, follow these instructions for submitting your work. First, you need to export the mixdown. Make sure that your file meets the following requirements:

* File name: YourFirstNameYourLastName-FinalProject.
* Format: Wave at 44.1kHz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution. You can use 48k/24 if you want, but be mindful of the file size as the higher resolutions will increase the amount of data.
* Do not adjust loudness.
* Make sure to export the Main output.
* Be sure that the duration of the resulting audio file matches what you expect.

After your file has been exported and you are happy with the end result, you need to package up everything for submission. Save everything in Studio One, and follow these steps:

* In the top menu bar, go to File and select "Save to New Folder"
    This will create a new copy of everything used in your project. This copy will not sync with any changes you make after saving, so may sure you are done with your project before doing this.
* Give the folder the name: " YourFirstNameYourLastName-FinalProject-ProjectFolder"
* Save the folder somewhere easy to find, like the desktop.
* When done, verify the following items are present in the folder. You don't need to open them, just make sure they are there.
    * Your project's .song file.
    * The media folder contains your audio recordings and samples.
    * The mixdown folder has your mixdown file you created above.
* When done, compress the file into a .zip folder and submit everything to your teacher per their specific submission instructions. 

Don't forget about the write up, we will be going over that next.

## Write up & End-of-Year Concert

The final portion of this project will be a concert presentation of the whole class' work. This concert may happen in a normal class meeting time, a final exam block, or be held as a separate event. If possible, it is always a good idea to invite the students, friends, or family, but this will be at the discretion of the teacher and the schedule for the remainder fo the school year.

At this Concert, each student will present their work with a paragraph about it. These can be spoken or typed, and include the following:

* Main inspirations/goals for the project.
* What their core field recording was.
* The most difficult part or their project, or the part enjoyed the most.
* Describe the track in 1-2 sentences.
* Give 1-2 things for the audience to listen for. 

This should be typed in whichever word processing software is being used for the class and submitted with the .zip folder containing the project session and mixdown. (If needed, the text file may be saved into the folder before it is zipped up.)


## Example Final Project

EXAMPLE PROJECT COMING SOON

### Proposal

### Work In Progress

### Finished Mixdown

Below is the exported Mixdown for the example Final Project. You can utilize this to listen to the example project right here in the book without downloading and opening the session folder.

### Completed Session

This .zip folder contains everything for the example project and can be opened on your computer when downloaded. It only uses effects that are built into Studio One 6 Professional, so you _shouldn't_ need to download any extra materials if you have all of those assets already installed. Studio One 6.2 or newer is ***REQUIRED*** in order to open the .song file
