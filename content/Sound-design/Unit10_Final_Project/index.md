# Unit 10: Final Project

You've done it! Congratulations! 

There is no more new course content after this point. To show off everything that you have learned over this course, we will be moving onto the final project: a completely original musical work created by you!

As you work on the project, outlined below, feel free to refer back to any of the previous units as well as the Resources section for any refreshers and be prepared to show off your project to the class!

## Example Final Project

### Proposal

### Work In Progress

### Finished Mixdown

Below is the exported Mixdown for the example Final Project. You can utilize this to listen to the example project right here in the book without downloading and opening the session folder.

### Completed Session

This .zip folder contains everything for the example project and can be opened on your computer when downloaded. It only uses effects that are built into Studio One 6 Professional, so you _shouldn't_ need to download any extra materials if you have all of those assets already installed. Studio One 6.2 or newer is ***REQUIRED*** in order to open the .song file
