Objectives:

* MIDI quantization editing
* Swing
* Humanize
* Manual adjustment
* Synth parameter automation


Instructions:

1. Open your DAW, create a new song/project with the title “YourFirstNameYourLastName-Lab7”. If prompted, use the following settings:
    * Sample Rate - 44.1kHz
    * Resolution - 16 bit
    * Tempo - your choice (try to get away from 120)
2. Open the Instruments tab of the Browser panel. Drag an instance of the Impact sampler instrument onto a new track in the Arrange window.
3. Load a preset in Impact and adjust settings as desired. Record a four bar drum part. Remember to utilize the metronome and precount from Lab 5 as needed while you write and record your part.
4. After your drum part has been recorded, open the piano roll editor and quantize. Then, explore some of the additional quantization and MIDI editing techniques such as swing and humanize.
5. When you are finished editing the drum part, drag an instance of Mojito or Mai Tai onto a new track in the Arrange window. Adjust settings as desired and record a part to accompany your drum part.
6. After your synth part has been recorded, open the piano roll editor and quantize. Then, explore some of the synth parameter automation other than volume, panning, and mute. You may want to manually test some synth parameters before deciding which ones you want to automate.
7. Before submitting your assignment, ensure that your song includes:
    * A drum part using the Impact instrument that has been “creatively” quantized (meaning that there is some application of swing, humanization, or manual shifting of notes after the initial quantization)
    * Two instances of Mojito or Mai Tai synth parameter automation that are NOT volume or pan – these can be on the same track or two different tracks if you decide to record a second synth part.
8. When you are finished, export the audio as instructed in “Mixdown Requirements” and submit both to your teacher.
9. As always, save a backup copy on your personal storage media. This can be a flash drive, SD card, or online cloud storage. Be sure to backup both the session AND the exported audio.


Mixdown Requirements:

* File name: YourFirstNameYourLastName-Lab7.
* Format: Wave or MP3 at 44.1kHz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution (128 kbps for MP3 files). Just one, you don’t need to mixdown two files.
* Do not adjust loudness.
* Make sure to export the Main output.
* Be sure that the duration of the resulting audio file matches what you expect. Your Lab project should be approximately 8 bars in duration.
* Be sure to follow your teacher’s guidelines for file submission.
