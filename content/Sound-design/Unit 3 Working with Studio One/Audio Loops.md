STudio One 6 comes with a large number of loops that can be utilized in your projects. These vary between audio files and MIDI data, but can both be easily dropped into a session for quick implementation. Keep in mind however that these can take up a large amount of storage space, so you may not be able to fit many on your computer. A few projects in this class will want you to utilize the loops, while others will specifically forbid it.

To find a loop, open the Browse window and go to the “Loops” tab. Here your installed loops are broken up first by style, then by instrument. Some collections may have further organization allowing you to navigate to a specific kind of loop while others stop at this level. To preview a loop click on it and you will see information about it appear at the bottom of the Browse panel. Press the play button to preview the loop. If adding a loop to the content it is important to check the tempo and key (if applicable) in order to make sure that there are no problems with the other content. You can manually change the loop’s tempo or transpose it to a different key, but the sound may change to no longer match what you are looking for, so be sure to listen both before and after! To use the loop, simply drag it into the desired track in your session. The loop will then act like any other audio or MIDI event.
