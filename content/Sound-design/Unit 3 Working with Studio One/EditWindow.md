When you double click on an even in Studio One, it will open the edit window on the bottom of the screen. (You can also open this by clicking the Edit button in the bottom right of the screen and selecting your desired event.) This window acts like a localized instance of Studio One where you can edit the fine details of an audio or MIDI recording. The specific layout of the Edit window will change depending on what kind of event you are editing.

Audio:
When editing audio you will see the waveform of your selected audio even in the Edit window. Keep in mind that this window is for directly editing the contents of the audio file, and not for processing the files through effects (like in the Mixing console). In this window we can see a mixture of new and familiar things. In general the toolbar that appears is identical to the one in the main Arrange window. Utilizing the tools here will only affect what is in the edit window, and not alter things globally. The new elements are:

Audio:

* Action Menu: This new button appears next to the macro toolbar button and will be the main one you utilize in this view. Clicking on this brings up a drop-down menu with a variety of actions you can do to your selected audio event. These include items such as normalizing, reversing, fade-ins, chord detection, etc.
    When right-clicking on an audio event in the main Arrange view, you can access this menu through the Audio sub-menu.
* The chords button appears next to the quantize menu and will allow you to detect chords present in the audio event and select those chords to apply actions to them.
* The last two buttons are used for visually arranging the Edit window. THe first button discussed here is next to the auto scroll button. This will sync the edit window with the Arrange window so that they are both visually lined up on the screen. Auto zoom is the final item on this toolbar and will automatically adjust the zoom to fit the entire event in the Edit window.

MIDI:

When editing a MIDI event, the view is very different. Instead of displaying the audio file, you can see the individual MIDI notes. This is the main way that you can adjust the MIDI content of a track. You can double click on the grid to add a MIDI note, then adjust the various values such as pitch and duration by moving the new note around on the grid.
* At the top right of the MIDI edit window are three viewing options. These change how the MIDI notes are displayed. The most common uses are the piano and drum views. The piano view will display all of the MIDI notes on a vertical piano roll, while the drum view will display only the beginning of each MIDI note in a grid layout. THe layout will automatically adjust depending on which instrument is on the selected track.
    The score view will display a musical score rendition of the MIDI notes. There are a handful of new options on the toolbar here. While this can be useful, it is not something covered in this course. If you would like more information on the Score View, check out that chapter in the [Online Studio One 6 manual](https://s1manual.presonus.com/#Score_Editor_Topics/Chapter-Score_Editor.htm?TocPath=Score%2520Editor%257C_____0).
* The action menu behaves the same as when editing audio, but will instead display actions relevant to working with MIDI. These include working with pitch, quantizing, filling notes, note velocity, etc.
* The next set of newly appearing buttons are all part of the quantizing toolbar.
    Note color will change the color of various elements of the MIDI notes.
    Select Automation by notes will allow you to select notes in th eMIDI roll, but instead of selecting the notes themselves, you can work with the automation tied to those notes.
    Auto-Quantize will quickly quantize the selected MIDI notes based on the quantization settings.
* Auto zoom appears here as well (in the same location) but the icon look different than in the Audio Editor.


There is no manual page specific to the edit window, but be sure to [check out this page on editing events](https://s1manual.presonus.com/#Editing_Topics/Edit_View_Event_Editing.htm?TocPath=Editing%257C_____16) (and the larger editing chapter in general) for more information on what you can do in the edit window.
