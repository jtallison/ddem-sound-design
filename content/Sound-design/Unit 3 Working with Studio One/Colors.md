Studio One 6 is incredibly customizable. One of the easiest things to customize are the colors of the software. This has no effect on the functionality or capabilities of Studio One 6, but can make the software feel like your own.

To change the color scheme, open Studio One, then in the menu bar click Studio One > Preferences. In the window that pops up, click on General > Appearance. This window will allow you to adjust a wide variety of color options. These include the base color for the Studio One windows, brightness, saturation, etc. You can also decide if plugins and the music score view appear in light or dark mode.

If you would like to adjust the colors but donâ€™t know where to begin, click on Load Preset to choose from a variety of preset color schemes, or to return Studio One 6 to the default. You can also save an arrangement as a preset by clicking Store Preset. The majority of screenshots taken on this web site utilize the dark green Acid Night preset instead of the default gray color.
