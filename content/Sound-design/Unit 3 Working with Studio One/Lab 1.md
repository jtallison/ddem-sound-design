Lab Objectives:

* Introduction to Event-based audio editing techniques and tools within the arrange window
* Splicing with the Split Tool
* Selecting, Moving, and Resizing with the Arrow Tool and/or Range Tool
* Copy, Paste and/or Duplicating Events
* Introduction to Event-based audio processing within the arrange window
* Working with audio events
* Importing audio files with Drag-and-Drop

Instructions:

1. Download DrumLoop1.wav, DrumLoop2.wav, PianoLoop1.wav, and/or PianoLoop2.wav from Google Drive. You can download all files as one folder here.
2. Open your DAW, create a new song/project with the title “YourFirstNameYourLastName-Lab1”. Use the following settings:
    * Sample Rate: 44,100 Hz
* Bit Depth: 16 Bits
* Tempo: 120 BPM
3. Drag one or multiple loop(s) onto new separate tracks in the arrange window.
4. Using only the basic editing/splicing techniques - copying, reversing, and speed/pitch manipulations - create 2 different variations of the original loops, each on their own tracks, each at least 2 bars/measures in length. You may end up using more than 2 tracks in your project as you move Events around and audition different parts and clips. Name the tracks of the variations “Variation 1” and “Variation 2” so that it is clear which ones are finished.
5. Ensure that all of your edits are snapped to the grid. When grid snapping is on, by default, regions and edits will snap to rhythmic divisions as you drag in the arrange window. To temporarily disable this behavior – e.g. if you need to make a tighter edit on an individual audio region – hold the shift key while dragging. If you notice the opposite behavior - that snapping only occurs while holding shift – simply press the N key to re-enable Snap to Grid.
6. When you are finished, follow the mixdown requirements to create a file that can be listened to by the teacher.
7. As always, save a backup copy on your personal storage media. This can be a flash drive, SD card, or online cloud storage. Be sure to backup both the session AND the exported audio.

Mixdown requirements:

* File name: YourFirstNameYourLastName-Lab1.
* Format: Wave or MP3 at 44.1kHz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution (128 kbps for MP3 files).
* Do not adjust loudness.
* Make sure to export the Main output.
* Be sure that the duration of the resulting audio file matches what you expect. You should have the variations play one after another in a SINGLE audio file with no gaps or pauses between the variations.
* Be sure to follow your teacher’s guidelines for file submission.
