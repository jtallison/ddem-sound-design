Objectives:
* Adding Sounds to Studio One
* Arranging audio events in both sequence and layers
* Simple audio effect implementation

Instructions:

1. Choose at least 40 different samples from the collections available from this link:  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DDetbKbiSx-SObodee-AXdr_m55aVHB6?usp=sharing 
2. Open your DAW, create a new song/project with the title “YourFirstNameYourLastName-Lab0”. Use the following settings:
    Sample Rate: 44,100 Hz
    Bit Depth: 16 Bits
    Tempo: 120 BPM
3. Sequence out the samples you choose into between 30-90 seconds of sound.  
    * You may repeat sounds only once in exactly the same manner.  If you repeat a sound more than once it should be changed in some way (loudness/EQ/fade in or out, etc.)  
    * At a minimum try to create a composition with 3 clear sections (distinct beginning, middle, and end for example).  You may also create a composition with a more elaborate form if you choose.  
4. Consider using techniques like volume automation, enveloping, layering, hocketing, crossfading, reversing, and EQ in the creation of your short composition. 
5. When you are finished, follow the mixdown requirements to create a file that can be listened to by the teacher.
6. Save a backup copy on your personal storage media. This can be a flash drive, SD card, or online cloud storage. Be sure to backup both the session AND the exported audio.

_extra challenge 1: Use at least 60 samples for your project._  
_extra challenge 2:  Use each sound only once._


Mixdown Requirements:

* File name: YourFirstNameYourLastName-Lab0.
* Format: Wave or MP3 at 44.1kHz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution (128 kbps for MP3 files).
* Do not adjust loudness.
* Make sure to export the Main output.
* Be sure that the duration of the resulting audio file matches what you expect. You should between 30 and 90 seconds of audio.
* Be sure to follow your teacher’s guidelines for file submission
