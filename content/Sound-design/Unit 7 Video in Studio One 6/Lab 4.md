Lab Objectives:

* Importing Video files into Studio One 6 Professional
* Lining up audio and Video elements
* Basics of Foley Sound Creation

Instructions:

There are two sets of instructions for this lab: One for if you have Studio One 6 Professional, and one for if your DAW does not have native video support. Follow the instructions that are appropriate for your class.

Instructions for Studio One 6 Professional:

1. Begin by finding a video file to use for this project. You are certainly welcome to supply your own video for this project, including one you shoot and edit yourself. If you need to find one online, your best sources are likely Archive.org and YouTube.
    * With Archive.org, video files from various categories are freely available to download. Many of them are in the Public Domain, meaning that their “exclusive intellectual property rights have expired, have been forfeited, have been expressly waived, or are inapplicable.” However, due to the times in which some of these older films were produced, some of them may contain offensive content. Please be sensitive to this matter if you are looking for videos on Archive.org. When downloading, simply choose the best quality file available to you.
    * Many videos on YouTube are likely subject to copyright claims. We will be using these videos for educational purposes under the Fair Use doctrine. Your video projects will only be shown in class, only stored locally, and deleted from the lab after the projects have been graded. Students will assume all legal responsibilities if they decide to distribute these videos elsewhere. Use a YouTube downloader site to download videos from YouTube - you should be able to find one easily through an online search.
2. Once you have your video file, drag and drop it into Studio One 6 and use the Arrow tool to trim the video event to a single scene. The trimmed portion should not exceed 100 seconds, and should begin immediately when playback starts.
3. Mute any audio present in the original clip.
4. Utilizing both the audio clips from Lab 3 as well as a handful of new audio recordings from freesound or archive.org, create Foley sounds for the main events in your scene. Be sure to include things such as footsteps, weather, environmental sounds, etc. If it is happening on the screen, you should be able to hear it.

_Optional: utilize panning and volume automation to have the sound files match their movement on the screen._

5. When you are finished, export the video as instructed in “Mixdown Requirements” and submit it to your teacher.
6. As always, save a backup copy on your personal storage media. This can be a flash drive, SD card, or online cloud storage. Be sure to backup both the session AND the exported video.

Instructions for using a DAW other than Studio One 6:

1. Begin by finding a video file to use for this project. You are certainly welcome to supply your own video for this project, including one you shoot and edit yourself. If you need to find one online, your best sources are likely Archive.org and YouTube.
    * With Archive.org, video files from various categories are freely available to download. Many of them are in the Public Domain, meaning that their “exclusive intellectual property rights have expired, have been forfeited, have been expressly waived, or are inapplicable.” However, due to the times in which some of these older films were produced, some of them may contain offensive content. Please be sensitive to this matter if you are looking for videos on Archive.org. When downloading, simply choose the best quality file available to you.
    * Many videos on YouTube are likely subject to copyright claims. We will be using these videos for educational purposes under the Fair Use doctrine. Your video projects will only be shown in class, only stored locally, and deleted from the lab after the projects have been graded. Students will assume all legal responsibilities if they decide to distribute these videos elsewhere. Use a YouTube downloader site to download videos from YouTube - you should be able to find one easily through an online search.
2. Once you have your video you will need to utilize a separate software in order to trim the video to a specific scene of your choice. This scene should be no longer than 100 seconds, and should begin immediately when playback starts. There are a few options for this. Each video software has its own unique way of working, so be sure to check out its relevant reference materials. There are other softwares available as well, so utilize the one that works best for you!
3. If using a Mac, iMovie is one of the quick, free options. The trimming method is the same as in Studio One. 
    * Adobe Premiere (Mac and Windows)
    * Davinci Resolve (Mac and Windows)

4. Once trimmed, watch through your clip at least 5 times. Be sure to note when specific events are happening such as footsteps, weather, etc. If it could potentially be heard in the scene, make a note of it and the specific second it happens at.
5. In your DAW, Use your list of sound events to place sound clips at the right place. You can utilize both the audio clips from Lab 3 as well as a handful of new audio recordings from freesound or archive.org.
6. When done, export the audio as a .wav or .mp3 file and import it into the video project.
7. Line up the audio and video. If your timings were good, then everything should fall easily into place with minimal adjustments.
8. Mute the original audio from your video (if present) and follow the instructions for your video software to export a .mp4 file with your sounds attached to the video. Try and follow the “Mixdown Requirements” as much as possible.
9. As always, save a backup copy on your personal storage media. This can be a flash drive, SD card, or online cloud storage. Be sure to backup both the session AND the exported video.

Mixdown requirements:

* File name: YourFirstNameYourLastName-Lab4.
* Format: MPEG-4 Video
* Video Codec H.264
* Audio codec: AAC (if available)
* Make sure to export the Main output.
* Be sure that the duration of the resulting audio file matches what you expect. Your Lab project should be between approximately 60 and 100 seconds in duration.
* Be sure to follow your teacher’s guidelines for file submission.
