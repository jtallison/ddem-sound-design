Lab Objectives:

* Field recording using a mobile recorder
* Importing audio from a device (you will not be recording directly into Studio One)
* Event-based audio editing techniques and tools within the arrange window
* Creating and editing Fades with the Arrow Tool
* _Optional: Strip Silence_

Instructions:

There are two different sets of instructions for this lab. One if your class has access to handheld, SD card recorders, and one if you will be using a cellphone.

Handheld Recorder Instructions:

1. Make sure you are able to work with your specific handheld recorder. Be sure to read through the operations manual to make sure you can create and save recordings.
    * Set the gain level to a cement amount. (ca. 5-7/10 is usually a good place to start) This is only an option on certain recorders such as the Zoom handy recorder line.
    * Make sure the bit depth is set to 16 bits or greater, and the sample rate is set to 44.1 kHz or greater.
2. Take the first half of lab time wandering around the building and immediate vicinity looking for interesting sounds. Remember to be respectful of those around you. Capture one example of each of the following on your portable recording device:
    * natural sounds - sounds that occur in nature (birds, water, tree leaves, wind, etc)
    * environmental sounds - sounds made by other humans or machines around you (talking, running, traffic, espresso machines, etc)
    * intentional sounds - a sound you make yourself that you find interesting (knocking on a metal handrail or locker, stomping in the stairwell, squeaky shoes, etc) 
3. Return to the lab with enough time remaining to import and edit your files.
4. Open your DAW, create a new song/project with the title “YourFirstNameYourLastName-Lab2”. Use the following settings:
    * Sample Rate: 44,100 Hz
    * Bit Depth: 16 Bits
    * Tempo: 120 BPM
5. Import the audio from your handheld recorder to the computer with the following steps:
    * Turn off the handheld recorder and remove the SD card
    * Insert the SD into the SD slot on your computer. You may need an adapter if your device uses microSD.
    * Locate your desired files within the folders on the SD card.
    * Drag and drop the desired files into the DAW session.
6. Look for interesting moments or sections in your files and isolate them by splicing and deleting undesired content. Tighten up the remaining audio regions by adding short Fades to the start and end of every region. 
7. _Optional: Depending on the source material, the “Strip Silence” function may work well to automate the first stage of this process. You will still need to manually clean up the regions that it leaves behind._
8. When you are finished, export the audio as instructed in “Mixdown Requirements” and submit it to your teacher.
9. As always, save a backup copy on your personal storage media. This can be a flash drive, SD card, or online cloud storage. Be sure to backup both the session AND the exported audio.

Cellphone Instructions:

1. Before starting, ensure that you are using a mobile app that is set to record in an uncompressed format such as .wav, .flac, or .aiff AND, if the options are accessible, that it is set to use a bit depth of 16 bits or greater and sampling rate of 44,100Hz (44.1kHz) or greater.

    * Sample Rate: 44,100 Hz
    * Bit Depth: 16 Bits
    * Tempo: 120 BPM
5. Import your newly recorded audio files into a location on your computer. The process for getting files off of your recording device will be a little different depending on the platform (iPhone, Android, or other). Once the files are on your computer, drag them onto new separate tracks in the arrange window.
    * Android instructions (Skip the installation step - the Android File Transfer application will already be installed on your lab computer.)
    * Apple Music Memos Instructions (You can use either the Share via email or Share via iTunes on a Mac options, though the latter requires an iPhone USB cable and knowledge of iTunes.)
    * Attach the files to an email and send it to yourself. Open on your computer and download.
    * Upload to a cloud storage service such as google drive or dropbox, then download on your computer.
6. Look for interesting moments or sections in your files and isolate them by splicing and deleting undesired content. Tighten up the remaining audio regions by adding short Fades to the start and end of every region.

9. As always, save a backup copy on your personal storage media. This can be a flash drive, SD card, or online cloud storage. Be sure to backup both the session AND the exported audio.

Mixdown requirements:

* File name: YourFirstNameYourLastName-Lab2.
* Format: Wave or MP3 at 44.1kHz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution (128 kbps for MP3 files). Just one, you don’t need to mixdown two files.
* Do not adjust loudness.
* Make sure to export the Main output.
* Be sure that the duration of the resulting audio file matches what you expect. Each sample should play one after the other, with no more than 2 seconds of silence between each one.
* Be sure to follow your teacher’s guidelines for file submission.
