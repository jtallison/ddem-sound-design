Throughout the course you will be doing a variety of medium-scale projects to explore various aspects of creating unique sounds with Studio One 6. Including a practice lab, there are 9 different lab projects. These include:

* Lab 0: Arranging Audio in a DAW
* Lab 1: Basic Audio Editing and DAW Introduction
* Lab 2: Recording and Importing Audio Files
* Lab 3: Crossfades, Automation, and using the Mixer
* Lab 4: Working with Video
* Lab 5: Basic MIDI Recording
* Lab 6: Synthesizers
* Lab 7: Advanced MIDI and Automation
* Lab 8: Plugins and Advanced Mixing

These labs are designed to be both harder and more open-ended than the practice assignments. This is to let the students be able to explore more in preparation for the larger projects of this course. The labs are intended to take 1-2 class periods to complete, however this can be adjusted as needed for the class schedule.

Each project has its own page which will detail the topics covered by each lab, the lab instructions, as well as the formatting for the completed fileâ€™s name and format. Be sure to read through this before beginning work on your lab.


Grading Rubric for Lab Projects:
This chart is given as a general guideline for grading the Lab projects. The approximate grades or point values are given, but may be scaled as needed for assignment weighting. This rubric grades the student following all lab instructions and submitting correctly and the technical aspects of the lab separately. Those two numbers are then added together for the final grade.
