Objectives:
* Exploring Mojito and Mai Tai virtual instruments.

Instructions:

1. Open your DAW, create a new song/project with the title “YourFirstNameYourLastName-Lab6”. If prompted, use the following settings:
    * Sample Rate - 44.1kHz
    * Resolution - 16 bit
2. Open the Studio One Reference Manual under the Help menu. Navigate to Built-In Virtual Instruments and read the entry for Mojito.
3. Open the Instruments tab of the Browser panel. Drag an instance of the Mojito instrument onto a new track in the Arrange window.
4. Do not load a preset. Instead, explore only the oscillator (OSC), amplifier (AMP), and filter (FLT) sections of Mojito. Make some changes until you like what you hear.
5. Open a text editor of your choice (TextEdit, Microsoft Word, Google Doc, etc.) and, in one or two sentences, describe one of the changes that you made - what parameter did you adjust, what was the effect on the sound, and why did you like it better after the adjustment?
6. Record a few MIDI notes using this new sound. You do not need to worry about setting up your metronome or composing a melody - this is just to serve as a quick reference for your instrument settings.
7. Repeat steps 3-6 with a second instance of Mojito on a new track. Make sure that it is clear in your writeup which instance you are referring to when writing your description.
8. Repeat steps 2-6 with one instance of Mai Tai. In Mai Tai, explore both oscillators (Osc 1, Osc 2), the filter (Filter), and the amplifier (Amp Env). You may also incorporate the Noise section if you wish, but ignore all other sections for now.
9. Save your writeup text file and be sure to include it along with your audio submission. When you are finished, export the audio as instructed in “Mixdown Requirements” and submit both to your teacher.
10. As always, save a backup copy on your personal storage media. This can be a flash drive, SD card, or online cloud storage. Be sure to backup both the session AND the exported audio.

Mixdown requirements:

* File name: YourFirstNameYourLastName-Lab6.
* Format: Wave or MP3 at 44.1kHz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution (128 kbps for MP3 files). Just one, you don’t need to mixdown two files.
* Do not adjust loudness.
* Make sure to export the Main output.
* Be sure that the duration of the resulting audio file matches what you expect. Your Lab project should have each synthesizer play one after another, with no more than 2 seconds of silence between them. The full recording should be under 48 seconds.
* Be sure to follow your teacher’s guidelines for file submission. DO NOT FORGET THE TEXT WRITE-UP PORTION OF THIS LAB!!
