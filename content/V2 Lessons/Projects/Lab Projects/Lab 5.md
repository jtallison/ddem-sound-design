Objectives:

* Basic MIDI recording and quantizing
* Working with Virtual Instrument presets
* Implementing Audio Loops

Instructions:

1. Open your DAW, create a new song/project with the title “YourFirstNameYourLastName-Lab5”. If prompted, use the following settings:
    * Sample Rate - 44.1kHz
    * Resolution - 16 bit
    * Tempo - will be changed later
2. Open the Loops tab of the Browser panel on the right side of the window. Find a drum loop that you like and change your song tempo to match the tempo of the loop - the selected loop’s tempo is listed at the bottom of the loop tab. Drag your loop onto a new track in the Arrange window.
3. Open the Instruments tab of the Browser panel. Drag an instance of the Mojito instrument onto a new track in the Arrange window. Ensure that your MIDI keyboard is working - press a few keys and you should hear a sound. If you do not, see me to make sure that your MIDI keyboard is set up correctly. Choose a bass preset sound from the preset dropdown menu in the software instrument’s window.
3. Play along with your drum loop a few times to come up with a bass line. Once you have something you want to record, turn your attention to the Metronome. Set a Metronome Precount for 2 bars - this means that when you hit record, you will hear 2 bars of clicks (8 beats) before the recording actually starts.
4. Record!
    * Arm the record enable button by the track name of your Mojito track. This will not be visible if you have automation showing.
    * Skip the playhead to the beginning of your song.
    * Click the record button in the transport bar. You should start hearing the metronome counting down - remember, it will give you 2 full measures (8 clicks) before it actually starts recording.
    * Play along with the drum loop like before - you’re now recording MIDI.
5 .You probably didn’t play the part perfectly. Double-click on the newly recorded MIDI region to open the piano roll editor at the bottom of the screen. Snap the notes onto The Grid using an operation called “Quantization”. Make sure that “Auto Quantization” is turned on via the AQ button. Select all of the MIDI notes in the piano roll with [Ctrl+A] on Windows or [Command+A] on Mac and select a value from the quantize dropdown menu. You might have to try a couple of different values - start with 1⁄8 and listen to see if that worked. If it did, your bass part should be perfectly in time with the drum loop. If it didn’t, try 1⁄4 or 1⁄16.
6. When you are finished, export the audio as instructed in “Mixdown Requirements” and submit it to your teacher.
7. As always, save a backup copy on your personal storage media. This can be a flash drive, SD card, or online cloud storage. Be sure to backup both the session AND the exported audio.


Mixdown requirements:

* File name: YourFirstNameYourLastName-Lab5.
* Format: Wave or MP3 at 44.1kHz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution (128 kbps for MP3 files). Just one, you don’t need to mixdown two files.
* Do not adjust loudness.
* Make sure to export the Main output.
* Be sure that the duration of the resulting audio file matches what you expect. Your Lab project should be between approximately 4-8 bars in duration.
* Be sure to follow your teacher’s guidelines for file submission.
