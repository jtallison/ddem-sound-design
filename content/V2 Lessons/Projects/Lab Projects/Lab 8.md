Objectives:

* Practice with Plugins as inserts
* Practice with routing and use of plugins on a submix/bus
* Practice with routing and use of plugins on an aux send

Instructions:

1. Open your DAW, create a new song/project with the title “YourFirstNameYourLastName-Lab8”. If prompted, use the following settings:
    * Sample Rate - 44.1kHz
    * Resolution - 16 bit
    * Tempo - your choice (try to get away from 120)
2. Create an Insert
    * Provide at least one example of a track with a plugin applied as an insert. Choose a plugin appropriate for this signal flow - e.g. EQ, distortion, etc.
3. Create a submix
    * Provide at least one example of two or more tracks submixed to a bus channel. A submix is created when the output of multiple channels are sent to a bus track rather than the main outs. Once you have a submix set up, apply a plugin on the bus channel appropriate for this signal flow - e.g. EQ, compression, etc.
4. Create an aux send
    * Provide at least one example of one or more tracks sent to a bus or FX channel using aux sends. Apply a plugin to the bus/FX channel appropriate for this type of signal flow - e.g. reverb, delay, etc.
5. When you are finished, export the audio as instructed in “Mixdown Requirements” and submit both to your teacher.
6. As always, save a backup copy on your personal storage media. This can be a flash drive, SD card, or online cloud storage. Be sure to backup both the session AND the exported audio.



Mixdown Requirements:

* File name: YourFirstNameYourLastName-Lab8.
* Format: Wave or MP3 at 44.1kHz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution (128 kbps for MP3 files). Just one, you don’t need to mixdown two files.
* Do not adjust loudness.
* Make sure to export the Main output.
* Be sure that the duration of the resulting audio file matches what you expect. Your Lab project should be approximately 8 bars in duration.
* Be sure to follow your teacher’s guidelines for submission.
