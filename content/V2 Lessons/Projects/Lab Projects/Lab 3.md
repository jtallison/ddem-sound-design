Lab Objectives:

* Crossfades
* Introduction to the Mixer/Console
* Volume and Pan Automation

Instructions:

1. Create a duplicate of your project from Lab Assignment 2. Rename the new copy “YourFirstNameYourLastName-Lab3”.
2. Download a few interesting audio files from Freesound.org and/or the University of Iowa Musical Instrument Samples repository. The content of the files is at your discretion, but they must be in an uncompressed format - this includes wav, aiff, Apple Lossless, FLAC or caf files. Mp3 or AAC are prohibited.
3. Drag-and-Drop these new files onto new tracks in your Lab Assignment 3 project.
4. For the remainder of the lab time, experiment with the three techniques listed in this assignment’s objectives. Your final submission at the end of the lab must include one example of each:
    * Crossfades
    * Using the Console to set static volume and pan values
    * Volume and/or Pan Automation: Look for intriguing ways to combine the sounds that you have collected so far - perhaps two audio files complement each other when their volumes are balanced a particular way, or a sound that sweeps across from the left to the right using pan automation is a dramatic introduction to a contrasting sound.
5. When you are finished, export the audio as instructed in “Mixdown Requirements” and submit it to your teacher.
As always, save a backup copy on your personal storage media. This can be a flash drive, SD card, or online cloud storage. Be sure to backup both the session AND the exported audio.


Mixdown requirements:

* File name: YourFirstNameYourLastName-Lab3.
* Format: Wave or MP3 at 44.1kHz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution (128 kbps for MP3 files). Just one, you don’t need to mixdown two files.
* Do not adjust loudness.
* Make sure to export the Main output.
* Be sure that the duration of the resulting audio file matches what you expect. Your Lab project should be between approximately 45 and 120 seconds in duration.
* Be sure to follow your teacher’s guidelines for file submission.
