Objectives:

* Audio Sends
* Parallel processing
* FX channels
* Pre/Post fader 

Instructions:

* Open a new Studio One session and load in a unique sound file. This sound file can come from a previous assignment or be freshly recorded for this assignment.
* Open the mixing console and create a new FX channel.
* Create a new send in the audio file track. Send the audio to the new FX channel.
    Now you will hear the audio coming through both channels
* Add the following effects to your FX channel in this order:
    EQ
    1-3 more of your choice
    Reverb
* Experiment with the values for each of the effects until you create a unique sound.
* Bring the volume fader for the original audio file all the way down to -∞
* Click the button to change the FX channel send to be pre-fader
    Look under sends
    Find the send to the FX channel on your original track
    Click the fader icon to the right of the volume indicator
    It should turn orange to indicate that the audio is being sent to the FX channel BEFORE it is affected by its own volume slider.
    The end result is that you should now ONLY hear your processed sounds.
* Slowly bring up the original sound until it blends with the processed sounds in an interesting way. Try to keep the FX channel louder than the original sound. If too loud, add a 0dB limiter to the main channel inserts.
* Export the mixdown and submit the assignment to your teacher.
