There are a total of 7 optional assignments that are designed to focus on a specific element of working in a DAW and allow students to get hands-on experience and create content prior to working on the lab projects and others that are part of the dual enrollment portion of this class. 

There is no timeline to complete these assignments. In fact the assignments are completely optional and can be skipped or re-ordered as needed by the teacher. They mainly serve to give the students extra practice and experience before the larger projects, as well as a starting point for teachers to make their own assignments. 

Practice assignments are intended to take no more than a class period to complete and are generally focused on technical competency over creative work. Practice Assignment 7 is the exception and will likely take between 2 and 4 days to complete. Each page goes over the objectives of the assignment, steps to complete it, and how to export the audio. Below is a simple guideline for grading the practice assignments.
