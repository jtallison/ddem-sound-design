Speaking from a purely scientific viewpoint, sound is the transfer of energy from one source to another through pressure waves vibrating against various elements in the environment. These waves can vary in size and frequency, but when they are detected by a person, we are hearing a sound. 

These vibrations travel at different rates through different media. When a person is referring to the speed of sound, they are usually talking about the speed of sound in air. Below isa chart showing the approximate speed of sound through various different media. Generally speaking, the denser the material, the quicker sound travels through it, but the quicker the energy decays.

In order to create these sound waves, something must first begin vibrating. The oscillations of this movement cause the air molecules around the source to get pushed into each other. The molecules then bounce off each other and into the next molecule. This process will repeat until the sound wave is absorbed by something else. 

The number of times per second (Hz) that these waves arrive at the human ear is called the frequency. Humans can, on average, perceive a sound that is within the range of 20-20,000 Hz. If a sound is outside of that range, then the sound is still there, humans just are unable to hear it. The range of human hearing will vary from person to person, and factors such as the volume of the original sound, distance from the sound, a person’s head shape, and age can all affect the range of hearing. Most people begin to lose their ability to perceive the higher end of this range as they reach adulthood.

In order to form a musical pitch, specific frequencies must be produced on an instrument. Because it is much simpler to refer to a note as “A” instead of 440Hz, people will utilize a repeating alphabetic scale to refer to certain frequencies. It is important to know that humans perceive frequency on an exponential scale. Meaning that every octave a pitch increases, the frequency must double. For example:

* A2: 110 Hz
* A3: 220 Hz
* A4: 440 Hz
* A5: 880 Hz
* And so on

When looking at music notation, every line and space on the staff is referring to a specific frequency to be created by the performer. 

Alongside the pitch of a sound is its volume. While the number of times an air pressure wave hit our ears per second is perceived as a pitch, the size of those waves is largely responsible for how we perceive volume. Generally speaking larger pressure waves = louder sound. The size, or amplitude of these waves is measured in decibels of air pressure (dB). Generally speaking, sounds exceeding 100 dB will cause discomfort to most listeners, and anything above 120 dB can cause pain and hearing damage. These ranges are approximate and do not take into account the listening time. While a shotgun blast is quite loud, a single instance of being exposed to that volume may cause less long-term damage than listening to music at 90 dB over a long period of time. When in doubt, it is important to take breaks from listening, and investing in hearing protection. It becomes much harder to create good music when you are unable to hear what you are doing.

By themselves, sound waves are just repetitions of pressure traveling through the air. It is the human ears and brain that are responsible for allowing us to hear and perceive different sounds. As the sound waves travel to us, the outer part of our ear, called the Pinna, acts like a satellite dish to gather the incoming waves and funnel them into the skull. (the majority of the human ear is inside of your head)

Inside of the ear the sound waves eventually hit the eardrum, or tympanic membrane, which further collects and funnels the vibrations through a series of bones to a small organ called the cochlea in the inner ear. The cochlea is filled with fluid and nerve endings that help the brain to interpret the incoming sound by acting like a filter. Sound waves of different frequencies will travel different distances along the cochlea and stimulate different nerves. This means that a 40 Hz sound and a 1000 Hz sound are stimulating different pathways to the brain, allowing us to perceive them as different pitches. A louder sound will also cause more stimulation of these nerves than a quieter sound.
