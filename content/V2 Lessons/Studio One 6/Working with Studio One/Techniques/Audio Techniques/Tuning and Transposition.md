Letâ€™s pretend that you have a handful or recordings, but they are all in different keys. With Studio One you can easily transpose both audio and MIDI events to whichever key you need. Simply select the event you wish to transpose and right click. In the popup menu you will see an option for transpose and tune. Adjusting the transposition will repitch the audio up or down. This tool accepts numbers between -24 and +24, and is defaulted to 0. Each number is a half step up or down, which means that you can transpose an audio clip up to two octaves up or down.

For smaller pitch adjustments you can utilize the tune option. This will tune the pitch in a range of -100 to +100 cents, defaulting to 0 again. This means that you can fine tune audio up to a whole step up or down. One useful way to use this is to select and correct small portions of a recording where a specific note may be just a little out of tune. Tuning works the same for both MIDI and audio

Transposing for MIDI can work a little differently. If you select an MIDI event, right click (or under the actions menu) and select transpose, a few more options appear. You can use the sliders to easily select octave transpositions, specific intervals, or setting all of the MIDI notes to the same pitch. These are all common ways to utilize MIDI transposition.
