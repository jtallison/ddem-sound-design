Foley is the art of adding realistic sounds to movies, tv, and radio. It was originally pioneered by Jack Foley in the 1920â€™s, the practice sought to bring a level of realness to the entertainment experience. In modern film and television, microphones are focused on getting the actor's dialogue, and are located far away from the sound source so as to remain off-screen. This means that many sounds in the scene are either ignored, removed, or otherwise not recorded. This can be problematic when wanting to create a realistic scene as there are more sounds than just dialogue in the real world. To offset this silence, Foley Artists will build up the environmental sounds of a film in order to create the desired environment.

Generally Foley artists will work by seeing what sound they have to recreate. This could be anything; if it is in the scene, it is fair game. Then they have to plan out how to make those sounds, and record them in sync with the recorded video. A simple example would be to record footsteps. A foley artist would find similar shoes and a surface to walk on in order to create the sound you would expect from the video, then record themselves walking in time with that video to create the footsteps. A mixing engineer would then balance the various recordings and layers of sound to create the final effect. 

Here are a few interviews with Foley Artists about what they do and how they do it:
