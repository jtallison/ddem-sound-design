The mixing console is the most important tool in Studio One for creating your own sounds and audio mixes. It displays everything that is happening in the DAW at once in a condensed, easy to understand format. However, if you have never worked with an analog audio mixer, the layout may still be a little confusing so let’s take the time to break it down.

Parts of the Mixing console:

The mixing console is accessed by the Mix button in the bottom right of the screen. It can be popped out, so I recommend putting it on a second monitor if you have one. Every channel, which is everything with audio in the project, will appear here from left to right. You will notice that each channel has basically the same elements, and the pattern repeats for everything in your session. 

Much like an analog mixer, you can think of the audio signal as moving from the top of the mixing console to the bottom. When the event is played back, the signal will enter the mixer and then be sent through the inserts. These are the audio effects that you are inserting into the signal pathway in order to alter the sound. 

The next section is for sending audio to other places in the mix. This is generally used for parallel processing, grouping audio channels together, or sidechaining audio effects.

The next section shows the audio channel’s input and output. This will usually indicate which interface microphone channel you are using, and if the audio is being sent to the Main output channel or somewhere else. Underneath this is a graphic representation of the channel panning. You can change this by dragging the blue bar left and right.

The four buttons below are Mute, which silences the channel when active. Solo, which silences all OTHER channels when active. Record Arm, which flags a track to record its input when the record button is hit. Monitor, which feeds the input for that channel directly into the Main output channel.

The slider controls the output gain for the channel. Moving it up makes the channel louder, but it is better practice to make things softer. This way you can balance things without distortion from making it too loud. Remember, if you can’t hear something, it is usually a better idea to make other things quieter before you make the first sound louder.

On the left of the Mixing console you will see several options for showing or hiding various things in the mixer. What was listed above is the default appearance, but you can choose to shore more or less information depending on your needs.  

Types of Tracks:

There are a few different kinds of channels that are present in the Mixing console. These are audio, instrument, Bus, FX, VCA, and Aux. Audio and Instrument are basically the same as what appears horizontally in the main window. These will appear automatically as you add more tracks. Some instruments, such as ImpactXT, will have multiple channels but only one track. A Bus channel serves as a collection or sub-mix. You can send various audio channels to a bus in order to process all of them the same way or adjust their volume all at once with a single fader. This is useful for things like drums where you may want to control the volume for all of a part at one time.

FX channels are used for parallel processing. This means that you are sending the same source through two different effect chains at the same time, and that each one has its own independent volume slider. This can be useful for adding effects like reverb to an FX track, then automating how much is present by adjusting the volume slider. You can send to the FX channel from the source channel’s send section.

VCA channels offer another way of working with groups of channels. By sending audio to a VCA channel, you can create a mix of the various instruments in the group, and then adjust all of their volumes without altering the balance with the VCA slider.

Aux channels will likely not be used much in this course, but they are utilized for receiving audio from external sources. If you connect a hardware synthesizer instrument or any other kind of audio to your audio interface, you can utilize an Aux channel. The Aux channels can be saved as presets so you can simply drag and drop them from the browse window to begin utilizing the input. When making the Aux channel you will need to set up the hardware input as a unique instrument, which is a process that varies depending on your operating system. You could also set up a cross-software Aux channel using the same process.
