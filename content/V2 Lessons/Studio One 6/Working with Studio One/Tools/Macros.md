A macro command is a (potentially) complex series of actions for the computer to execute that can be easily triggered with a single click or button press.

Macros are a wonderful tool for quickly and easily doing a variety of actions in Studio One. You can access the Macro menu by clicking the Macro key in the top toolbar. By default there are a large number of macros already created by Presonus, but you can make your own depending on your specific workflow.

The preset macros are all broken up by category, which can be changed via the dropdown menu in the Macro panel. For this class, some of the most useful macros are the pitch macros, music creation, and the explore macros. 

To create your own macros, follow this tutorial created by Presonus.
