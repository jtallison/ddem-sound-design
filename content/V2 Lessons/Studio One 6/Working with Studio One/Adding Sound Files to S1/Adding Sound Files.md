Adding content to a Studio One session is simple. The first thing you need is an audio file. We will go over how to record in Studio One, but for now let’s use these pre-recorded files. 

There are several ways to import a file into Studio One 6. The first is to utilize the browse window to find the file you want. This is useful, but it can be difficult to navigate through a large number of folders. We will instead utilize this method for plugins and synthesizers. Studio One is created to utilize a drag-and-drop for adding content. This is extremely useful as you can open the computer’s file browser, select multiple files, and drag them into the session all at once. When adding these files, if no track is available, one will be automatically created, and the type of track will depend on the file being selected.

There are several different kinds of tracks. These can be created via the track menu at the top of the screen, or more quickly through the + icon in the top-left section of the screen. 
Audio tracks are for audio files. You can select the track’s input, whether it is stereo or mono, and a few other settings.
Instrument tracks are for software plugin instruments. These can be selected here or later from the Browse menu.
Automation tracks only include automation information for a specific track. These will likely be the least-used tracks in this class since automation can be applied directly onto an Audio or Instrument track.
Folder tracks are used for grouping together multiple other tracks. For example, in a larger mix, you could group together all of the microphones used on the drumset into a larger folder, or create a folder for the various vocal tracks. Effects and automations applied to the folder tracks are applied to everything within the folder.
When making a track, you can give the tracks a name, choose a preset for the track, adjust the track color, and how many copies of the track that you wish to make.
