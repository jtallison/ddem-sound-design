EarSketch is a free educational programming environment. Its core purpose is to teach coding in two widely used languages, Python and JavaScript, through music composing and remixing. This learning environment was developed first at Georgia Institute of Technology (from 2011) under Prof. Jason Freeman (School of Music) and Prof. Brian Magerko (School of Literature, Media, and Communication).

EarSketch is web-based, which means users can access it with their web-browsers, and with no installation. No account is required to create projects or view existing projects.

EarSketch comprises different elements: a curriculum, a digital audio workstation (or DAW), a code editor and console, and a sound browser. EarSketch's sound library was created by Young Guru, Jay Z's sound engineer, and famous sound designer Richard Devine.
