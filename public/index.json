	"content": " The mouse tools allow direct interaction with Events, using the mouse. It is helpful to remember that actions done using the mouse tools can be undone at any time, so feel free to explore them. You can click the right mouse button in any open space in the Arrange or Edit views to open a list of mouse tools and editing commands. Choose the desired tool or command by clicking it with the left mouse button. You can also click the middle mouse button (or scroll wheel) to display an expanded list of tools to choose from, including all Paint tool shapes.\nArrow Tool This tool is selected by default. Click on the Arrow tool button or press [1] on the keyboard to select the Arrow tool. The Arrow tool can be used for the following purposes:\nMove an Event To move an Event using the Arrow tool, click anywhere on the Event and drag left, right, up, or down. Dragging the Event left or right moves the Event backward and forward in time, relative to the current Timebase and Timeline zoom. When dragging an Event left or right beyond the viewable arrangement, hold [Space Bar] on the keyboard to speed up the scrolling.\nDragging the Event up or down moves the Event to another existing Track of the same type. If the Event is dragged to a position where no Track currently exists, Studio One creates a new Track of the same type.\nWhen dragging an Event from one Track to another (up or down), the position of the Event is constrained within an automatic snapping range to make it easy to keep the Event at the same time position. To defeat this snapping, hold Shift while dragging the Event up or down.\nSize an Event Events can be thought of as windows into audio files and musical performances, where what you see is what you hear. Sizing is a fundamental technique wherein Events are made shorter or longer, so that only a portion of the audio or musical data they contain is seen and heard. To size any Event using the Arrow tool, float the mouse to the left or right edge of the Event to reveal the Sizing tool. When this tool appears, click-and-drag left or right to size the Event. Events can be sized and resized nondestructively any number of times.\nTwo adjacent Events can be sized simultaneously so that no gap is created between them. To do this, float the Arrow tool to the bottom of where the two Events meet in the Timeline, where you can see the sizing icon with both left and right arrows illuminated, and then click-and-drag left or right.\nHolding [Alt]/[Option] on the keyboard and then sizing an Event from the right edge results in the Event being freely timestretched. Refer to the Timestretching section of this chapter for more information.\nAdjust Audio Event Volume Envelopes All Audio Events feature a basic volume envelope that allows the volume of the audio to be shaped in several ways. Using the volume envelope, you can create a fade-in and fade-out, as well as set a constant volume level between the fades. The volume envelope applies gain changes to the audio clip in the Event and is therefore at the front end of the audio signal path.\nTo create a fade-in or fade-out, click-and-drag left or right on the Fade Flag in the upper left or right corner of an Audio Event. By default, a linear fade is created over the length you have moved the Fade Flag. Fade times, as well as Event gain, can also be edited in the Inspector for any selected Event.\nTo change the curve of the fade, click on the Fade Curve box in the middle of the fade curve and drag up or down. The fade curve determines how quickly or slowly the fade occurs and changes over time. If you press and hold [Shift] while editing the fade length or the curve, you can edit both at once. Dragging up or down edits the curve, and dragging left or right changes the length.\nIt is also possible to drag a complete crossfade left or right, or up or down, in order to change the location and characteristics of the fade. Float the mouse to the center of the crossfade until the Hand icon appears, then click and drag to adjust. Dragging left or right adjusts the location of the fade, extending or shortening the crossfaded Events. Dragging up or down alters the shape of the crossfade.\nTo adjust the overall volume level of an Audio Event, click on the volume box in the center of the volume envelope and drag up or down. As you adjust the volume envelope, the audio waveform is redrawn to approximate the effect of the adjustment.\nSelect Multiple Events Multiple Events can be selected in order to edit them all at once, with a single action. To select multiple Events with the Arrow tool, do one of the following:\nClick outside of the range of an Event, and then drag over any other Events; a gray box is drawn while you drag over the target-selection area. Release the mouse button once the box is drawn over all of the Events you wish to edit, and these Events are selected for editing. Click on any Event, then while holding [Shift] on the keyboard, click on any other Events to select them. This allows you to select multiple Events that are not in close proximity to each other. All selected Events can then be edited at once. Click on any Event, then or , to select all Events on between the start of the Song the current Event. Click on any Event, then Double-click on the timeline of a Track in the Arrange or Edit view while holding [Shift], to select all Events present on that Track. Normally, when you select multiple Events and adjust volume or fade in/out shape on one of them, all selected Events change to match the new setting. If you want to adjust an individual Event without losing your selection, hold [Alt] while making your changes.\nAlternate Arrow Tool Uses For speed and efficiency when editing, a selection of modifier keys can be applied while the Arrow tool is selected, giving temporary access to the following alternate tools and editing modes:\n Range Tool Hold [Ctrl]/[Cmd]. Slip Editing Hold [Ctrl]/[Cmd]+[Alt] while floating the Arrow tool over an Event. Define Tempo Hold [Ctrl]+[Alt]/[Command]+[Option] while floating the Arrow tool over the edge of an Event.

Choose the desired tool or command by clicking it with the left mouse button. You can also click the middle mouse button (or scroll wheel) to display an expanded list of tools to choose from, including all Paint tool shapes.\nRange Tool The Range tool is used to select a range, or area, within Events. Click on the Range tool button or press [number 2] on the keyboard to select the Range tool.\nTo select a range within an Event, using the Range tool, click-and-drag over the area to be selected; a gray box is drawn over the target selection area. Release the mouse button when the box is drawn over the range of the Events you wish to select. The range you have selected is now treated as a single, consolidated Event.\nFor instance, you can use the Range tool to select the content of several Audio Events across multiple Tracks in bar 12, and then use the Arrow tool to move that section of audio to bar 14. Another common use of the Range tool is to quickly select and delete a range of audio within an Event, rather than using the Split tool to make two splits, then select and delete the section with the Arrow tool.\nWhen you float the mouse cursor over a selected range, the Arrow tool temporarily appears. This makes it easy to quickly select and edit a range of Events.\nTo select multiple, non-contiguous ranges across any Event, on any Track, hold the [Shift] key while using the Range tool. Continue to hold [Shift] and use the Arrow tool to select whole Events. For instance, when using the Arrow tool, if you press and hold [Ctrl], you get the Range tool. Press and hold [Ctrl] and [Shift] to select multiple ranges, then continue to hold [Shift] but release [Ctrl]; now you have the Arrow tool and can select whole Events. All of your selections remain selected.\nIf Snap to Grid is enabled, your selections using the Range tool snap to the value set by the Snap Timebase parameter. To temporarily reverse the Snap to Grid option while editing, hold the [Shift] key.\nSelected ranges can be sized by floating the Range tool at the left/right edge of the selection. You also can split a selected range at the left and right edges of the selection by choosing Split Range from the Edit menu or by pressing [Ctrl]/[Cmd]+[Alt]+X after selecting a Range.\nTo temporarily switch to the Arrow tool while the Range tool is selected, hold [Alt].\nText reproduced from the official Studio One Version 3.3.0 Reference Manual\nCopyright © 2016 PreSonus Audio Electronics, Inc\n"

Click on the Split Tool button, or press [number 3] on the keyboard to select the Split tool.\nWith the Split tool selected, a vertical and horizontal line is drawn near the current mouse-cursor position. The vertical line indicates the exact time position of the Split tool, while the horizontal line underscores the Track on which the Event to be split resides. The Split tool is directly affected by the current Snap settings.\nClick on any Event with the Split tool to split the Event at that position. By splitting a single Event, you create two Events that can be edited independently. If multiple Events are selected across multiple Tracks, the Split tool affects all of the selected Events in the same way.\nIt is also possible to split selected Events at the timeline cursor, without using the Split tool, by pressing [Alt]+[X] on the keyboard.\nTo temporarily switch to the Arrow tool while the Split tool is selected, hold [Alt].\nSplitting Instrument Parts Normally, if you split an Instrument Part at a point that falls within one or more notes, those notes are truncated at the split point, and no longer play in the newly created Part to the right of the split point. This can be an issue, especially when splitting up Parts in which some notes are held for long periods, such as pad and string passages.\nFor example, if you have a four-bar Part in which a chord is played and held throughout, splitting the Part in the middle leaves the Part to the left of the split point mostly untouched. However, the held notes are now missing from the newly created Part to the right of the split point.\nTo split an Instrument Part and split (rather than truncate) any notes that cross the split point, hold [Alt]/[Opt] while you make the split.\nText reproduced from the official Studio One Version 3.3.0 Reference Manual\nCopyright © 2016 PreSonus Audio Electronics, Inc\n"

For instance, if you have a keyboard loop collection in which every loop is in the key of C, being able to transpose these loops to any other key opens up many possibilities.\nIn Studio One, transposing and tuning are a part of the same set of advanced algorithms as timestretching, so the quality is extremely high.\nTo transpose any audio Event, select it and open the Inspector by pressing [F4] on the keyboard or clicking on the Inspector button above the Track Column. Then enter a value in the Transpose field, from -24 to +24 semitones.\nTuning is similar to transposing but the pitch is changed in cents, rather than semitones. Enter a value from -100 to 100 cents in the Tune field to fine-tune the audio Event.\nAny number of Events can be selected and transposed or tuned simultaneously, but note that this change is not relative to the current setting of each Event. All selected Events are transposed or tuned to the same chosen value.\nThe Transpose and Tune fields are also available by right-clicking [Cmd-clicking on some Macs] the desired audio Event.\nText and image reproduced from the official Studio One Version 3.3.0 Reference Manual Copyright © 2016 PreSonus Audio Electronics, Inc\n"

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": " This document provides basic instructions for DAW media management and submission procedures specific to our software and course management utilities.\nThe File Structure of a Studio One 3 Song Studio One 3 can create new Songs and new Projects.\nThis nomenclature varies from one DAW to the next.\nStudio One 3 Projects can be thought of as mastering projects - a collection of multiple finished pieces that might form the basis for a full multi-song album or a feature film soundtrack. Often, final preparations like track timing and matching volumes from one song to the next are done during this mastering stage.\nIn this class, we will only be dealing with Studio One 3 Songs - generally, a project in which a single song from an album or cue from a film soundtrack is composed, edited, and/or mixed. When starting a new Song in Studio One 3, a folder with the same name as the Song title is created. By default, this folder is created in Documents\u0026gt;Studio One\u0026gt;Songs (Mac) or My Documents\u0026gt;Studio One\u0026gt;Songs (Windows).\nInside this Song folder you should find one or more of the following:\n .song file with the same name as your Song title. Bounces folder Cache folder History folder Media folder Mixdown folder The most important of these are the .song file and the Media folder. They are both absolutely crucial for backing up, transferring, duplicating, saving, and submitting your projects.\nAny audio files created within your Song (i.e. ones that you record yourself into the song) are stored in the Media folder.\nAll of the other folders, while they are important for other reasons, can usually be recreated if necessary.\nAlthough the Media folder is very important, it is possible to have a Song with no Media folder if recording only MIDI.  Consolidating a Song Although audio recorded directly into your Song is stored in the Media folder, audio that is added through other methods (e.g. Drag-and-Drop) is not automatically moved or copied to the Media folder. It is instead referenced in its original location by the Studio One .song file. For example, if you download a file from Freesound.org and drag it directly into the Studio One Arrange window from your Downloads folder, by default, it will stay in the Downloads folder and not copy or move to the Song\u0026rsquo;s Media folder.\nWhy do we need to know this? If a Song is backed up and/or transferred without properly consolidating the audio files, it will be missing content, and the finished product will likely not sound as intended. Fortunately, the method for consolidating all audio files into the Media folder is very easy. Simply chose \u0026ldquo;Copy External Files\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; from the Song menu in Studio One. Studio One 3 will then show a list of which files need to be copied, at which point you can simply click \u0026ldquo;Yes.\u0026rdquo; If nothing needs to be copied, you will receive a message that says \u0026ldquo;There are no external files.\u0026rdquo;\nTransferring a Song Consolidate your Song first by running \u0026ldquo;Copy External Files\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Then, copy the entire song folder - NOT only the .song - to your external media. This folder is the one that contains one or more of the .song file, Cache folder, Media folder, etc.\nDuplicating a Song Much like transferring a Song, the first step is to run \u0026ldquo;Copy External Files\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Then, run \u0026ldquo;Save to New Folder\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; from the File menu in Studio One. This will ensure not only that all necessary media is duplicated, but also provide an opportunity to give the duplicate version a different name.\nSubmitting a Song This step should be followed for all Lab Assignments (at the end of the lab hour), Mini Compositions, and the Final Project. Additional instructions may be part of the individual assignment descriptions, so be sure to double-check those documents before submitting.\n First, consolidate your song following the instructions above, then save again after consolidating. Regardless of which computer you\u0026rsquo;re working on, first ensure that the main iMac at the large mixing desk is on. The following steps WILL NOT work if that computer is not on first. On the desktop is a shortcut called \u0026ldquo;MUS2745 Spring 2018 Submissions\u0026rdquo;. Double-click to open that folder. If prompted, chose to connect as \u0026ldquo;Guest\u0026rdquo;. You should now see a an \u0026ldquo;MUS2745 Spring 2018 Submissions\u0026rdquo; window with folders labelled for all of our semester assignments and projects (Lab 1, Lab 2, Mini Composition 1, etc). Drag the song folder for your submission into the corresponding folder inside \u0026ldquo;MUS2745 Spring 2018 Submissions\u0026rdquo;. If you would like, you can then go over to the main iMac at the mixing desk to open your project from the same \u0026ldquo;MUS2745 Spring 2018 Submissions\u0026rdquo; folder to ensure that everything works and all files transferred. It is up to you to make sure that I can open your project on that computer for grading.  "

Click on the Sort by options at the top of the Browser to sort by one of the following categories:\n Flat Sorts the instruments in alphabetical order in a continuous list. Folder Works much like Flat, but adds category folders. Folders can be used to quickly sort and find available instruments by function (such as Synth or Sampler). For more information, see Folders. Vendor Sorts the instruments in folders by vendor. Type Sorts the instruments in folders by type (PreSonus, ReWire, Audio Unit, VST2, VST3).  Dragging Virtual Instruments into Your Song When you have found a virtual instrument you wish to use in your Song, you can simply click-and-drag it into the Arrange view from the Browser. If you drag the instrument into blank space, the virtual instrument is loaded in the Instruments Device Rack, and a new Instrument Track is created that is routed to the instrument. The new Track is record-enabled and monitor-enabled by default, so you can play it immediately with your default Keyboard.\nIf you drag-and-drop an instrument from the Browser on top of an existing Instrument Track that is routed to another virtual instrument, the previously loaded instrument is replaced by the new one. A pop-up menu appears, giving you the choice to Replace (remove the old instrument from the Instrument Rack and replace with the new), Combine (place the new and existing instruments into a new Multi Instrument), or Keep the old instrument (re-route the Track to address the new instrument and retain the old instrument in the Instrument Rack).\nInstrument Presets The presets for Studio One’s built-in virtual instruments, as well as those associated with any 3rd-party instruments, can be loaded into your Song in the same way as an instrument. Drag-and-drop a preset from the Browser to load the instrument into your Song with that preset pre-loaded. Alternatively, when the instrument is open, you can load any preset for that instrument by simply double-clicking on the preset in the Browser or by clicking on the preset to select it and then hitting [Return]. If the editing window for an instrument is open, you can load any preset for that instrument by dragging the preset from the Browser onto the instrument window.\nText and image reproduced from the official Studio One Version 3.3.0 Reference Manual\nCopyright © 2016 PreSonus Audio Electronics, Inc\n"

If you want to duplicate an Instrument Part and link the content of the duplicates to that of the original Part, select the Part and choose Duplicate Shared from the Edit menu, or press [Shift] + [D] on the keyboard. A ghost icon appears on the original Part and any Shared duplicates, to alert you that those copies are now Shared. Any edits made to the original Part or a Shared copy are applied to all instances of that Part.\nIf you later decide you wish to edit one of the Shared copies of a Part individually, select it and choose Separate Shared Copies from the Event menu. The ghost icon disappears from that Part to alert you that the copy is no longer Shared, and can be edited without affecting the other copies.\nText reproduced from the official Studio One Version 3.3.0 Reference Manual\nCopyright © 2016 PreSonus Audio Electronics, Inc\n"

	"content": " Description For your final project, you will compose a 3:00-5:00 original piece to be presented at the end-of-semester concert on Wednesday April 25. This project will be based in some manner on an original field recording – e.g. something you recorded in a coffee shop, while walking around campus, or an interesting collection of sounds from your kitchen. Otherwise, the form and genre of the project is completely up to you, so long as it can be presented in some format at the concert and uploaded to the class SoundCloud. Otherwise, it only needs to meet the guidelines listed below.\n A rough-draft at least 1:00 in length that demonstrates the main ideas of your project must be submitted by Monday April 9 for in-class peer evaluation. At minimum, this should include an edited high-quality version of your intended field recording. Submission file sizes cannot exceed 10MB - this may require an mp3 Mixdown or a conversion of a WAV mixdown to mp3 using another software utility like XLD on Mac, Audacity, or a free online mp3 converter. If converting to mp3, please ensure that you set your bitrate to a minimum of 192kbps (higher is fine). Submit this rough draft to the designated assignment on Moodle and be prepared to talk about your project for a few minutes in class - no other files need to be submitted at that time. The final draft of your project is due Friday April 20 and must adhere to the following guidelines:   All work MUST be done in Studio One. Use of \u0026ldquo;canned\u0026rdquo; loops (pre-made loops in Studio One or other commercial products) is prohibited. Your project must include at least one track containing audio that demonstrates some of the concepts and editing techniques from the musique concrète tradition (splicing, speed manipulation, pitch shifting, sampling, etc). Your project must include at least one track utilizing a built-in Studio One synthesizer instrument. Your project must include at least one instance each of mixer automation (volume and/or pan) and instrument automation (filter cutoff, LFO frequency, etc). Your project should be well-mixed (good balance between tracks, stereo spatialization) and use effects appropriately (EQ, compression, reverb). There is no minimum guideline for this category, but students that clearly put thought and attention into the balance, spatialization, and timbral qualities of their piece will earn more points. All MIDI must be well-edited and/or quantized as applicable. Your project must feature your original field recording in a signifiant way.   For the final draft submission, you will need to submit a Mixdown in addition to your song project folder. Use the 16bit/44.1 setting in the wav format. Listen to this Mixdown file all the way through to ensure it is free of errors and clipping. When you are finished, ensure that your project has the name \u0026ldquo;YourFirstNameYourLastName-FinalProject\u0026rdquo; and submit using the procedure in the Basic Submission Instructions document. Make sure that both the Mixdown file and any other files are stored inside your song project folder before submitting. As always, save a backup copy on your personal storage media.

This does not have to be comprehensive - focus on the few things that are most interesting and relevant to the members in your group. Anything that is not common knowledge (e.g. dates, widely known facts) MUST be cited using the Chicago style Author-Date format. The final slide in your presentation should be your list of references. Do not use Wikipedia as a source. Interviews, web articles, Twitter posts by the actual artists, etc are all acceptable sources.\n25 points\nA \u0026ldquo;Listen For\u0026rdquo; Slide – :30 One slide with a quick overview of salient and interesting features of the piece. This should be just enough info to tell us about what we\u0026rsquo;re about to hear - prep your audience.\n15 points\nOverall analysis – 3:00-5:00 3-5 slides that provide a simplified version of the timed descriptions in the Holmes guide. You will be showing (and only showing, not talking about) these slides and changing from one to the next in time with the music. They should be concise enough for your audience to read without being distracted from the listening experience. The total number of slides will vary depending on the form of the song. Each slide should have a few important bullet points for that section - What changed from the last section? What should we be listening for now? What are any especially important or striking features of this section? Is there anything that strays from the primary elements that you originally told us to listen for?\n25 points\nGuided Discussion – 3:00 Chose one single feature from the song that you would like to explore further – a transition, the sound of one particular synth, some social commentary on the lyrics, etc. Lead a discussion on this topic. You should hear from a few of your classmates during this section. You can use a few short listening examples from your song during this discussion to illustrate your point - make sure you have the track times sorted out ahead of time!\n25 points\n"

	"title": "Impact",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": " Impact features a grid of pads into which samples are loaded and played back independently, as with many popular hardware drum-sample players. Each pad has its own pitch, amplifier, and filter controls with accompanying envelopes. There are multiple stereo and mono outputs for each pad, making sophisticated output busing simple.\nInterface Impact is arranged as a 4x4 grid of pads, with controls for each pad. Below each pad are Solo and Mute controls, as well as an Output Channel assignment. Click on any pad to select it and view its parameters, located on the right side of the interface. In the lower left corner of the waveform display are Offset Start and End controls, which let you offset the playback of a sample start or end from -0.5 to 0.5 s. To the right of these controls are Add and Remove sample buttons for adding or removing a sample from the currently selected pad, as well as Previous and Next buttons to select the previous or next sample in the same file location as the existing sample.\nAbove these controls on the far right is a sample-zoom control, with a scrollbar to the left. Click on the Zoom control to zoom in or out on the sample, and use the scrollbar to scroll across the sample left or right if zoomed to a level where the entire sample is not viewable.\nAdd and Play Samples To add a sample to a pad, drag any audio clip from the Browser, or any Audio Event or selected range from the Arrange view, directly onto the desired pad. If you drag in a selected range from the Arrange view, the range is bounced to a separate audio file and then added to Impact. Dragging a sample to a pad that already contains a sample replaces the old sample with the new one, by default. To clear a pad of all samples, [Right]/[Ctrl]-click on the desired pad and select Clear Pad.\nOnce a sample has been added to a pad, you can trigger the sample by clicking on the pad with the mouse or by playing that pad’s assigned note on your Keyboard. There are two note assignments per pad, displayed at the bottom left and right corners of each pad. You can change the note assignment by clicking on a pad, then clicking in the Trigger 1st or 2nd fields in the lower left corner of Impact and either entering a value or playing a note on your Keyboard.\nEach pad has a selectable playback mode in the lower right corner of Impact. You can choose from the following:\n One Shot Poly This mode means the pad trigger starts playback of the entire sample, which does not stop until the end of the sample is reached. If multiple triggers occur before the end of the sample is reached, the sample is played multiple times at once, with each new triggered sample overlapping the any other playing voices. One Shot Mono This mode means the pad trigger starts playback of the entire sample, which does not stop until either the end of the sample is reached, or another pad trigger occurs. Toggle This mode means the pad trigger starts playback of the sample, and if another pad trigger occurs while the sample is playing, the sample stops playback. Note On/Off This mode means that the note-on event for the trigger starts sample playback, and the note-off event stops it. Sync To the right of the Play mode selection box is a Sync checkbox. Engage this option if you would like sample playback to start on the nearest beat to the trigger time, as determined by the Arrange quantize value. To solo a pad so that you hear only its sound when it is triggered, click on the Solo button beneath the desired pad. To mute a pad, so that pad is not be heard when triggered, click on the Mute button beneath the desired pad.  Note that each pad has its own Pitch, Filter, and Amplifier controls.\nMultiple Velocity Layers It is possible to add more than one sample to a pad, enabling you to trigger different samples based on velocity. For instance, you may want to have three different samples for a single snare drum pad: one soft, one medium, and one loud. This way, when you play Impact, the snare drum sounds much more realistic than if you use a single sample.\nTo do this, hold [Shift] when dragging a sample or clip to a pad. This adds a new layer to the pad, indicated by the bar graph in the sample display. Click-and-drag the bar graph left or right to alter the velocities at which the samples trigger. The velocity range for the currently selected sample is highlighted.\nPitch Control You can modify the pitch for each pad’s sample using the Pitch controls.\n Pitch Envelope  Attack Adjusts the amount of time from when the pad is triggered to when the envelope value is reached. Variable from 0 s to ∞. Hold Adjusts the amount of time the envelope value is held after the attack period and before decay begins. Variable from 0 s to ∞. Decay Adjusts the amount of time it takes after the hold period to return to the envelope value. Variable from 0.98 ms to ∞.  Pitch  Envelope Adjusts the detune range of the pitch envelope in cents. Variable from -1,200 to 1,200 cents. (The default value is 0, meaning the pitch envelope has no effect.) Velocity Adjusts the maximum detune value, in cents, that pitch is affected by velocity (the maximum detune value when triggered note velocity equals 127). Variable from -1,200 to 1,200 cents. Transpose Adjusts the transposition in semitones for the selected pad. Variable from -10 to 12. Tune Adjusts the tuning, in cents, for the selected pad. Variable from -100 to 100 cents.   Amplifier Control To adjust the amplitude for each pad, use the following parameters:\nAmp Env  Attack Adjusts the amount of time from when the pad is triggered to when maximum amplitude is reached. Variable from -∞ (no attack, sample starts at maximum amplitude) to 0 s to ∞. Hold Adjusts the amount of time the maximum velocity is held after the attack period, before decay begins. Variable from 0 s to ∞. Decay Adjusts the amount of time it takes after the hold period to reach an amplitude of -∞ from the maximum amplitude. Variable from 0.98 ms to ∞.  Amplifier  Velocity Adjusts the maximum amplitude value, in dB, affected by velocity (the maximum amplitude value when triggered note velocity equals 127). Variable from -∞ to 0 dB. Pan Adjusts the sample’s stereo pan for the selected pad. Variable from -1 (L) to 1 \u0026reg;. Gain Attenuates or boosts the amplitude, in dB, of the sample assigned to the selected pad. Variable from -∞ to 6 dB.  Filter Control Each pad features a variable filter to allow anything from subtle tonal shaping to heavily processed filter sweeps.\n Filter Env  Attack Adjusts the amount of time it takes for the filter cutoff frequency to move from the frequency value to the envelope value once a sample has been triggered. Variable from 0 s to 10.1 s. Hold Adjusts the amount of time the envelope value is held after the attack period and before decay begins. Variable from 0 s to ∞. Decay Adjusts the amount of time it takes to return to the cutoff level after reaching the envelope value. Variable from 0.98 ms to ∞.  Envelope Adjusts the range of the filter envelope in octaves, relative to the cutoff value. Variable from -10 to 10. (The default value is 0, meaning the filter envelope has no effect.) Velocity Adjusts the maximum value in octaves affected by velocity . Variable from -10 to 10 (the maximum value when triggered note velocity equals 127). Cutoff Adjusts the cutoff frequency of the filter. Variable from 30 Hz to 16 kHz. Reso Adjusts the resonance of the filter. Variable from 0 to 100. Filter Type Selects the filter type. Choose from LP (low-pass), BP (bandpass), and HP (high-pass) and between 12 and 24 dB slopes.  Grouping Pads Pads can be grouped so that when one pad in the group is triggered, the other pads in the group are choked, or silenced. You can add pads to one of four groups by doing the following:\n Select a pad you wish to assign to a Group by clicking on it. Click on the Choke select box and choose group 1, 2, 3, or 4. Repeat the process for any pad you wish to assign to a group.  Now, when a pad that is in Group 1 is triggered, all other pads in Group 1 are silenced. This, for instance, can be used to silence different hi-hat samples, so that when a closed hi-hat sample is played following an open hi-hat sample, the open hi-hat sample is silenced to prevent it from ringing through the closed hi-hat sound. This can add realism to your drum sounds.\nUsing Multiple Outputs Impact provides eight stereo outputs and eight mono outputs for each pad. To change the output routing, click on the Output selection box below the desired pads and choose the desired Output Channel for each pad. If the Output Channel does not already exist in the Console, it is added automatically.\nText and image reproduced from the official Studio One Version 3.3.0 Reference Manual\nCopyright © 2016 PreSonus Audio Electronics, Inc\n"

	"content": " Recording and Importing Audio Files Prerequisites Content from Lab Assignment 1\nPreparation of a mobile audio recording app of your choice on your personal mobile device:\n Select and install an app that has the ability to record uncompressed audio - this includes wav, aiff, Apple Lossless, FLAC or caf files. Apps that record only in mp3 or AAC are prohibited. Test recording of uncompressed audio. Test file transfer from mobile device to computer. If you do not own a mobile device capable of recording audio (iPhone, Android, or other portable standalone recorder), one will be provided for you at the lab meeting time.  Review the following document from our course materials:\n Basic Submission Instructions  Objectives:  Field recording using a mobile recorder Importing audio from a device Event-based audio editing techniques and tools within the arrange window  Creating and editing Fades with the Arrow Tool Optional: Strip Silence    Before starting, ensure that you are using a mobile app that is set to record in an uncompressed format (see file types in Prerequisites) AND, if the options are accessible, that it is set to use a bit depth of 16 bits or greater and sampling rate of 44,100Hz (44.1kHz) or greater. Take the first half of lab time wandering around the building and immediate vicinity looking for interesting sounds. Remember to be respectful of those around you. Capture one example of each of the following on your portable recording device:   natural sounds - sounds that occur in nature (birds, water, tree leaves, wind, etc) environmental sounds - sounds made by other humans or machines around you (talking, running, traffic, espresso machines, etc) intentional sounds - a sound you make yourself that you find interesting (knocking on a metal handrail or locker, stomping in the stairwell, squeaky shoes, etc) Return to the lab with enough time remaining to import and edit your files.   Open your DAW, create a new song/project with the title \u0026ldquo;YourFirstNameYourLastName-Lab2\u0026rdquo;. If prompted, use the following settings:   Sample Rate - 44.1kHz Resolution - 16 bit   Import your newly recorded audio files into a location on your computer. The process for getting files off of your recording device will be a little different depending on the platform (iPhone, Android, or other). Once the files are on your computer, drag them onto new separate tracks in the arrange window.   Android instructions (Skip the installation step - the Android File Transfer application will already be installed on your lab computer.) Apple Music Memos Instructions (You can use either the Share via email or Share via iTunes on a Mac options, though the latter requires an iPhone USB cable and knowledge of iTunes.)   Look for interesting moments or sections in your files and isolate them by splicing and deleting undesired content. Tighten up the remaining audio regions by adding short Fades to the start and end of every region.\nOptional: Depending on the source material, the \u0026ldquo;Strip Silence\u0026rdquo; function may work well to automate the first stage of this process. You will still need to manually clean up the regions that it leaves behind. When you are finished, submit your project using the procedure in the Basic Submission Instructions document. As always, save a backup copy on your personal storage media.  "

	"content": " Video Workflow There will not be any files to submit for this lab. We will consider it a work day to familiarize yourself with a Video Workflow process in preparation for Mini Composition 2. You do not have to use the exact procedure outlined for this exercise. However, the steps described below use software already available to you in the SoM203 lab. Your primary objective should be to work through all of the sections below and approach the instructor if you need further instructions or clarifications. You do not need to decide on the video you will be using for your Mini Composition 2 during this lab, though it is recommended.\nSoftware and sites referenced:  iMovie Studio One Archive.org YouTube YouTube downloader sites (various)  Finding a Video You are certainly welcome to supply your own video for this project, including one you shoot and edit yourself. If you need to find one online, your best sources are likely Archive.org and YouTube.\nWith Archive.org, video files from various categories are freely available to download. Many of them are in the Public Domain, meaning that their \u0026ldquo;exclusive intellectual property rights have expired, have been forfeited, have been expressly waived, or are inapplicable.\u0026rdquo; However, due to the times in which some of these older films were produced, some of them may contain offensive content. Please be sensitive to this matter if you are looking for videos on Archive.org. When downloading, simply chose the best quality file available to you.\nMany videos on YouTube are likely subject to copyright claims. We will be using these videos for educational purposes under the Fair Use doctrine. Your video projects will only be shown in class, only stored locally, and deleted from the lab after the projects have been graded. Students will assume all legal responsibilities if they decide to distribute these videos elsewhere. Use a YouTube downloader site to download videos from YouTube - you should be able to find one easily through an online search.\niMovie You will likely need to use iMovie twice throughout this process - once to trim your initial video file down to the desired length (before importing into Studio One), and again to align your finished audio mixdown with the video file.\nPreparing Your Video Simply import the raw video into iMovie, create a new project, insert your raw video into the empty project, trim it to the appropriate length, and export the new shortened version through the Share menu. The resulting file is ready to import into Studio One.\nImporting video into Studio One Importing video into Studio One is generally as simple as dragging the video file into the Studio One arrange window. For a more thorough explanation, see the Import Video instructions. Once a video is in your timeline, you can simply compose your soundtrack along with the video. For more help or further details, see this instructional video or search for \u0026ldquo;video\u0026rdquo; inside the Studio One reference manual. Keep in mind that once your soundtrack is finished, you will NOT actually be exporting the video from Studio One, only the new audio mixdown. You will need to use iMovie again to align your finished audio mixdown with the video file. NOTE: This is one of the few instances in which the Pro version of Studio One is required for your assignment. Video import and the video track playback window are not available in the Artist or Prime (free) versions. To work on Mini Composition 2, you may decide to activate the 30 day demo of Studio One Pro on your personal computer, use the Artist or Prime versions to compose soundtrack ideas without the video, or do all of you work during open lab hours.\nFinishing Your Video To re-align your new audio mixdown audio with your video file, drag both your video file and audio file into an iMovie project (you may re-use the original project that was used to shorten the original raw video file if it is still accessible). Move the audio mixdown as needed so that the timing is correct. If desired, mute the original audio from your video file. Then, as before, export the new shortened version through the Share menu. The resulting file is ready to submit with your Mini Composition 2 folder.\n"

However, they occasionally need to be reconfigured. This section of the manual is crucial to ensure that you know how to configure MIDI devices in Studio One, both at home and in the lab.\nObjectives:  Basic MIDI recording and quantizing Working with Virtual Instrument presets   Open your DAW, create a new song/project with the title \u0026ldquo;YourFirstNameYourLastName-Lab5\u0026rdquo;. If prompted, use the following settings:   Sample Rate - 44.1kHz Resolution - 16 bit Tempo - will be changed later   Open the Loops tab of the Browser panel on the right side of the window. Find a drum loop that you like and change your song tempo to match the tempo of the loop - the selected loop\u0026rsquo;s tempo is listed at the bottom of the loop tab. Drag your loop onto a new track in the Arrange window. Open the Instruments tab of the Browser panel. Drag an instance of the Mojito instrument onto a new track in the Arrange window. Ensure that your MIDI keyboard is working - press a few keys and you should hear a sound. If you do not, see me to make sure that your MIDI keyboard is set up correctly. Choose a bass preset sound from the preset dropdown menu in the software instrument’s window. Play along with your drum loop a few times to come up with a bass line. Once you have something you want to record, turn your attention to the Metronome. Set a Metronome Precount for 2 bars - this means that when you hit record, you will hear 2 bars of clicks (8 beats) before the recording actually starts. Record!   Arm the record enable button by the track name of your Mojito track. This will not be visible if you have automation showing. Skip the playhead to the beginning of your song. Click the record button in the transport bar. You should start hearing the metronome counting down - remember, it will give you 2 full measures (8 clicks) before it actually starts recording. Play along with the drum loop like before - you’re now recording MIDI.   You probably didn’t play the part perfectly. Double-click on the newly recorded MIDI region to open the piano roll editor at the bottom of the screen. Snap the notes onto The Grid using an operation called “Quantization”. Make sure that \u0026ldquo;Auto Quantization\u0026rdquo; is turned on via the AQ button. Select all of the MIDI notes in the piano roll with [Ctrl+A] on Windows or [Command+A] on Mac and select a value from the quantize dropdown menu. You might have to try a couple of different values - start with 1\u0026frasl;8 and listen to see if that worked. If it did, your bass part should be perfectly in time with the drum loop. If it didn’t, try 1\u0026frasl;4 or 1\u0026frasl;16. When you are finished, submit your project using the procedure in the Basic Submission Instructions document. As always, save a backup copy on your personal storage media.  "

If prompted, use the following settings:   Sample Rate - 44.1kHz Resolution - 16 bit   Open the Studio One Reference Manual under the Help menu. Navigate to Built-In Virtual Instruments and read the entry for Mojito. Open the Instruments tab of the Browser panel. Drag an instance of the Mojito instrument onto a new track in the Arrange window. Do not load a preset. Instead, explore only the oscillator (OSC), amplifier (AMP), and filter (FLT) sections of Mojito. Make some changes until you like what you hear. Open a text editor of your choice (TextEdit, Microsoft Word, Google Doc, etc) and, in one or two sentences, describe one of the changes that you made - what parameter did you adjust, what was the effect on the sound, and why did you like it better after the adjustment? Record a few MIDI notes using this new sound. You do not need to worry about setting up your metronome or composing a melody - this is just to serve as a quick reference for your instrument settings. Repeat steps 3-6 with a second instance of Mojito on a new track. Make sure that it is clear in your writeup which instance you are referring to when writing your description. Repeat steps 2-6 with one instance of Mai Tai. In Mai Tai, explore both oscillators (Osc 1, Osc 2), the filter (Filter), and the amplifier (Amp Env). You may also incorporate the Noise section if you wish, but ignore all other sections for now. Save your writeup text file inside your Studio One song file so that it gets submitted along with the other content. When you are finished, submit your project using the procedure in the Basic DAW Instructions document. As always, save a backup copy on your personal storage media.  "

If prompted, use the following settings:   Sample Rate - 44.1kHz Resolution - 16 bit Tempo - your choice (try to get away from 120)   Open the Instruments tab of the Browser panel. Drag an instance of the Impact sampler instrument onto a new track in the Arrange window. Load a preset in Impact and adjust settings as desired. Record a four bar drum part. Remember to utilize the metronome and precount from Lab 5 as needed while you write and record your part. After your drum part has been recorded, open the piano roll editor and quantize. Then, explore some of the additional quantization and MIDI editing techniques described below. When you are finished editing the drum part, drag an instance of Mojito or Mai Tai onto a new track in the Arrange window. Adjust settings as desired and record a part to accompany your drum part. After your synth part has been recorded, open the piano roll editor and quantize. Then, explore some of the synth parameter automation techniques described below. You may want to manually test some synth parameters before deciding which ones you want to automate. Before submitting your assignment, ensure that your song includes:   A drum part using the Impact instrument that has been “creatively” quantized (meaning that there is some application of swing, humanization, or manual shifting of notes after the initial quantization) Two instances of Mojito or Mai Tai synth parameter automation that are NOT volume or pan – these can be on the same track or two different tracks if you decide to record a second synth part.   When you are finished, submit your project using the procedure in the Basic Submission Instructions document. As always, save a backup copy on your personal storage media.  Quantization settings and additional MIDI editing in the piano roll editor: You can open the Quantize tools in the Piano Roll editor by clicking the Q button at the top of the editor. As long as your MIDI notes are selected (CMD-A for select all), they will be quantized or processed according to whatever options you chose in the Quantize toolbar.\nSwing The swing parameter will shift notes on the upbeats away from the grid. Higher percentages will result in more dramatic shifts, though sometimes a subtle use of the swing parameter can be very effective.\nHumanize Humanize is available from the Action menu in the Piano Roll Editor. Running the Humanize action while notes are selected will randomly shift their timing slightly off the grid, making the performance a little less perfect but potentially more “natural”.\nManual Adjustment Holding Shift while dragging notes will prevent them from snapping to the grid. You can use this technique to make individual notes happen just a little early or late (a technique often used in hip hop and neo soul drum programming). This can be especially effective on snare drums or claps.\nMiscellaneous Look at some of the other actions in the Action menu – “Length” and “Velocity” are particularly helpful. They can help to make the lengths and velocities of MIDI notes that you recorded more even and regular if desired.\nSynth Parameter Automation: Volume and pan automation are automatically available when you click on the Show Automation button to the left of the arrange window. Automating other parameters is nearly the same process:\n Click the Automation view button in the upper left, then use the track Automation view menu to chose the desired Automation parameter. Volume and pan show up automatically when dealing with audio tracks. With instrument tracks, we need to add the desired parameters before we can start editing them. Chose “Add/Remove\u0026hellip;” from the track Automation view dropdown menu to find the parameter you want to adjust.  "

	"content": " A metronome makes audible clicks or other sounds that correspond to beats at a selectable tempo, providing the musicians with a tempo reference while recording. This is especially useful when recording drums or other rhythm-intensive tracks, as the editing and arranging processes are made much easier when the recorded audio lines up with musical bars and beats.\nIn Studio One, the metronome can be engaged and disengaged both globally and for each hardware output in the Console, including the Main Out and any Sub Outs.\nTurn the Metronome On/Off Manually In the Transport, the Metronome button is to the left of the Master Volume fader and meter. Click on the Metronome button, or press [C] on the keyboard, to globally engage and disengage the metronome. The metronome is globally disengaged by default.\nThe Output Channels in the Console also feature Metronome buttons and level controls above the volume fader. These controls allow you to choose, for each output, whether or not the metronome is heard, and its level.\nMetronome Setup Click the Metronome Setup button (next to the Metronome button in the Transport) to access the Metronome Setup menu. In this menu, you can configure sounds and behavior for the metronome, as well as Precount and Preroll.\nHere, you can choose an individual sample and volume level for Beats, Accents, and Offbeats. Accents play on the downbeat, or first beat, of each new bar. Offbeats play in the space between each Beat. You can choose from seventeen default samples for each, including Click, Clave, Rim Shot, and Tambourine. By default, the Accent Level setting is higher than the Beat Level setting, as most musicians like to have the downbeat of each bar emphasized to help keep time.\nMetronome Presets Once you have configured the Metronome, you can save the current setup as a preset by clicking the [Store] button. These presets can be recalled at any time by clicking the [Load] button.\nPrecount and Preroll Precount and Preroll are two methods you can use to signal the start of recording and give a sense of the song\u0026rsquo;s tempo to a musician before recording begins. When you click Record with Precount enabled, the metronome clicks for the number of bars specified in the Bars parameter, before recording starts. When you click Record with Preroll enabled, Studio One starts playback behind where the cursor is placed, by a number of bars specified by the Bars parameter. When playback passes the cursor position, recording starts.\nWhen Precount is enabled, pressing record shows a countdown in the record button, of the number of beats remaining before recording starts.\nPrecount can also be enabled by clicking the Precount button, to the left of the Metronome buttons in the Transport, or by typing [Shift] + [C]. Preroll can also be enabled by typing [O].\nRepeat Accent This setting repeats the Accent sound when using a time signature with more than one accent per bar, such as 12\u0026frasl;8. You can try this out by doing the following:\nOpen the Metronome settings, and chose a sound for the Accent that is different from both the Beat and the Offbeat. Leave the Repeat Accent checkbox empty. Make sure the Click in Play option is active, so that you can hear the Metronome during playback. Set the time signature to 12\u0026frasl;8, and either click the Play button or press the Space Bar. You’ll notice the Accent is only heard every 12 beats. However, if you go through steps 3 and 4 with the Repeat Accent function switched on, the Accent is heard every 3 beats.\nClick in Precount Only When recording is triggered with Pre-Roll engaged, as discussed in the Precount and Preroll section of this chapter, a specified number of Precount bars play before reaching the current playback cursor position. The number of Precount bars is specified in the Metronome Setup menu. In this same menu, there is a checkbox to engage the Click Only in Precount option, which is disengaged by default.\nWith Click Only in Precount engaged, the metronome provides a traditional count-in during the Precount bars and is not heard beyond those bars.\nClick in Play The Click in Play option in the Metronome setup menu allows you to enable/disable the Metronome during playback, as opposed to while recording. Disabling Click in Play allows you to leave the Metronome engaged in the Transport at all times, so that if you are recording, you hear a click, but if you are playing back, you do not hear the click. Click in Play is engaged by default; click on the Click in Play checkbox to disengage the Metronome during playback.\nRender Metronome You can create an Audio Track of the Metronome by clicking the [Render] button located in the upper-right corner of the Metronome Setup window, and choosing one of the Render range options. These options allow you to create a click track that is either the full length of your Song, or just the length of a looped range within it, such as 4, 8, or 16 bars.\nText and images reproduced from the official Studio One Version 3.3.0 Reference Manual Copyright © 2016 PreSonus Audio Electronics, Inc\n"

	"title": "Mojito",

	"description": "",
	"content": " Mojito is a simple, monophonic, subtractive synthesizer with effects that is capable of generating a wide range of sounds. It models a classic analog synthesizer and features a low-aliasing oscillator and a 24 dB filter emulation. Mojito can generate killer bass sounds, lead sounds, and special effects.\nInterface Mojito is organized into Oscillator (OSC), Amplifier (AMP), Filter (FLT), and FX sections, with easy-to-use, yet powerful controls.\nOscillator Mojito’s Oscillator section is on the upper left of the plug-in window. Here you can set up the harmonic content of the sound source. The basic controls are the three large knobs on top: Pitch, Wave, and Width.\n Pitch Adjusts the frequency from one octave below to one octave above the played note. Note that this affects the cutoff frequency only via key tracking. Pitch is modified by the pitch-bend wheel (± 2 semitones). Wave Selects between a sawtooth wave and a pulse wave. These two waveforms have a rich and regular harmonic content, making them classic sources for subtractive synthesis. Sawtooth waves contain the fundamental and all harmonics whereas pulse waves have only the fundamental and odd harmonics. Mixed settings effectively adjust the level of the even harmonics. Width Adjusts the pulse width of the pulse wave from almost zero to square. This adjusts the balance between the fundamental and the higher and lower harmonics.  Below the three main OSC controls is a smaller row of knobs that adjust how much the oscillator settings are modulated. The speed of the modulation is adjusted using the LFO Speed controls, located to the right of these knobs. The LFO can be synced to tempo or it can oscillate with a freely adjustable period. Use the modulators to create chorus-like or string-like sounds, vibrato, and other familiar modulated sounds.\nThere is also a Sub Oscillator knob, which can be adjusted from 0 to 100% to add more low frequency content to the sound.\nThe Portamento section lets you control pitch slewing between notes. Using the mode selector, you can choose between three modes:\n Off A note that is played while another note is playing silences the previous note and trigger the new one. Legato An overlapped note does not trigger a new envelope but the pitch slowly changes to the pitch of the new note. Retrigger An overlapped note retriggers the current envelope, starting at its volume at the moment it is retriggered. This also slowly changes the note’s pitch. Note velocity is not applied or updated for overlapped notes.  The Time knob adjusts the glide speed (that is, the duration of the pitch change) when using portamento. The range is from 5 ms to 1 s.\nAmplifier Below the Oscillator section is the Amplifier section. This consists of a Gain control, which responds to MIDI Volume messages, and a Velocity-to-Volume control, which modulates the volume of a note in response to key velocity.\nThe most important part of this section is the ADSR envelope. (“ADSR” stands for “Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release.”) With these four sliders, you can adjust the amplitude characteristics over time. These characteristics play a huge role in defining the overall sound. The ADSR envelope can control the volume of a played note and can also control the filter cutoff.\n A Adjust the attack time, which is the time required for the sound’s amplitude to go from zero (silence) to full amplitude. The range is from 2 to 500 ms. D Adjusts the decay time, which is the time required to drop from full amplitude to the sustain level. The range is from 2 ms to 1 s. S Adjusts the sustain level, which is the level that is held from the end of the decay until the key is released. The range is from -96 dB (silence) to 0 dB (full amplitude). R Adjusts the release time, which is the time required to fall back to silence after the key is released. The range is from 2 ms to 2 s.  Filter The section on top of the right side of Mojito only affects the resonant 24 dB low-pass filter.\n Reso Controls the resonance of the filter, which is an amplification, or emphasis, of the signal at the cutoff frequency.  Note: If the amount of resonance of a filter is raised high enough, the filter begins oscillating at the cutoff frequency, thus generating its own waveform. Be careful: this can be loud!  Drive Controls the amount of filter drive from 0 to 100%. Cutoff Knob Controls the corner, or cutoff, frequency, which is the point above which frequencies are attenuated. The range is from 20 Hz to 16 kHz.  The other controls affect the modulation of the cutoff frequency.\n Key Controls how much the played note scales the cutoff frequency. Velo Controls how much the velocity of the played note shifts the cutoff frequency up or down. Envelope Controls how much the ADSR envelope shifts the cutoff frequency up or down. LFO Controls the amount of shifting that the filter LFO applies to the cutoff frequency. The LFO can either be synced to tempo or it can oscillate with an adjustable period.  FX On the bottom right is a small effects section where you can apply a modulation effect to enliven or broaden the sound. Mod Depth controls the amount of this effect. Using Mod Color, you can adjust the timbre from a flanger-like to a chorus-like effect. The modulation utilizes an LFO that has the same speed as the filter LFO.\nFinally, there is an Overdrive, the amount of which is controlled by the Drive control.\n"

	"content": " Notes on DAW Instructions Since all modern mainstream DAW software comes with sufficient documentation from the manufacturer, we have taken an approach that utilizes as much content from the official manuals as possible. This documentation can be supplemented as needed with additional online content, visual aids, in-class demonstrations, and more at the instructor\u0026rsquo;s discretion.\nFor this example course content based on PreSonus\u0026rsquo; Studio One 3, small sections of the Studio One 3 Reference Manual have been duplicated, with proper attribution, in separate Markdown files. This allows for the implementation of links within assignment instructions to relevant documentation materials - that is, relative links that point to the corresponding Markdown files within our repository. This approach was taken due to the fact that the Studio One 3 Reference Manual is accessed through a viewer wth the actual Studio One application, rather than as a separate PDF file or online source.\nSome DAWs, such as Apple\u0026rsquo;s Logic Pro X or Ableton\u0026rsquo;s Live 9, provide official documentation online. This allows for a simpler implementation of absolute links that point to the appropriate url and would likely reduce or eliminate the need for custom Markdown documentation.\nPDF manuals can also be utilized using a combination of relative links and anchor links that point to a specific page within the document, provided that the PDF is included in the course repository.\nFor more information on implementing links in Markdown, please reference John Gruber\u0026rsquo;s Markdown Syntax Documentation.\n"

In Studio One, these devices are referred to as Keyboards. Before recording a performance with a Keyboard, the MIDI keyboard controller must first be set up in Studio One. Once a Keyboard is set up, it is available at all times for use in Studio One.\nTo set up your Keyboard, navigate to Studio One/Options/External Devices (Mac OS X: Preferences/External Devices) and follow these steps:\n In the Options/External Devices menu (Mac OS X: Preferences/External Devices), click on the [Add\u0026hellip;] button. Choose your device from the predefined device list or set this to New Keyboard if you do not see your device in the list. If set to New Keyboard, you may wish to type in a Manufacturer Name and a Device Name in the appropriate fields. This makes identifying your Keyboard easier. Specify which MIDI channels to used to communicate with this Keyboard. All MIDI channels are selected by default. If you are unsure of the appropriate MIDI channels to use, just leave this at the default setting. Engaged Split Channels if you would like to create a separate Instrument Track input for each MIDI channel from the Keyboard. Specify the device to which the Keyboard is sending and the device from which it is receiving via Studio One. Select your device driver name from the drop-down menu for both Receive From and Send To. You can choose to use this Keyboard as your Default Virtual Instrument Input by checking the appropriate box. If you are using only one Keyboard with Studio One, you should check this box. Your Keyboard is now ready for use in Studio One. Click on the \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; button in the External window of the Console to quickly set up a new Keyboard or other External Device.  "

	"description": "",
	"content": "It is quite common that, as the result of continuous recording, some Audio Events may have gaps of silence or relatively low levels between performances. It may be helpful in these cases to remove the gaps and only keep the desired sections of the recorded Event. Studio One\u0026rsquo;s Strip Silence function, controlled from the Strip Silence panel, is designed to handle this task.\nOpen the Strip Silence panel by clicking on the Strip Silence button in the toolbar, or select Strip Silence from the View/Additional Views menu. Select the Audio Events from which you wish to strip silence, make the desired settings, and then click on [Apply]. Click on the [Default] button to return all settings in the panel to their defaults.\nThe result of the Strip Silence process is similar to using a gate processor to only allow the desired signal to be heard, except that the Event is edited.\nWhen the small light indicator next to the [Apply] button is lit, this means that changing the Detection or Event options and then clicking Apply automatically undos the previous operation, making it easier to find the right settings by viewing the result of the Strip Silence process, then tweaking the settings if needed without having to undo manually. Any change in selection (or other editing operation) ends this automatic state, and the indicator is no longer lit.\nThe following describes each setting:\nDetection This determines how Studio One identifies silence in the areas you wish to process.\n Material The first three options set the Open and Close Threshold for the gate algorithm automatically.  Lots of Silence Choose this for material that contains lots of silence and single hits—for instance, a clean, typical single-drum recording (hat, kick). Little Silence Choose this for material that has some action going on but still has some silence—for instance, minimal techno/single drum loops, ride, or snare tracks. Noise Floor Choose this for material where there is almost no real silence—for instance, noisy drum recordings, overheads, drum mixes, and drum loops. Manual Allows the Open and Close Threshold to be manually edited.  Open Threshold Set between -80 and 0.00 dB. Threshold Link Engage to link the Close Threshold to the Open Threshold. Close Threshold Set between -80 and 0.00 dB.  Events This section determines the nature of the Events created after removing silence.\n Minimum Length Determines the minimum length in seconds for any resulting Event. Pre-Roll Determines the amount of time in seconds that should remain at the beginning of resulting Events from the time at which the previously detected silence ends. Post-Roll Determines the amount of time in seconds that should remain at the end of resulting Events from the time at which newly detected silence begins. Fade-In Determines the length in seconds of the linear fade-in applied to resulting Events. Fade-Out Determines the length in seconds of the linear fade-out applied to resulting Events. Link Enable this option to automatically set the Fade-In parameter to match the Pre-Roll setting, and the Fade-Out parameter to match the Post-Roll setting.

	"uri": "/computer-music/daw-instructions/console-intro/",
	"title": "The Console",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": " Mixing in Studio One is primarily done in the Console. Open the Console by clicking on the [Mix] button or by pressing [F3] on the keyboard.\nEach channel of audio in your Song is represented by a Channel in the Console. Audio Tracks in the Arrange view are directly represented by Audio Channels in the Console, whereas Instrument Tracks have no direct representation in the Console. Instead, Instrument Channels represent the audio output of virtual instruments. There are several other Channel types discussed below, including Input, Output, Bus, and FX Channels.\nIt is important to note that the Console opens by default in Small mode, and the following descriptions assume this mode is engaged unless otherwise noted. For more on this topic, refer to the Alternative Console Layout section of this chapter.\nChannel Features The following features are common to all Channels.\nInput/Output At the top of each Channel is a display of its configured Input and Output, with the Input shown at the top and the Output below it. All Channels are configured with Main Out as their Output by default.\nAudio Channels show the hardware audio input selection. Instrument Channels display the name of the virtual instrument from which they get their input. Bus and FX Channels display a graphical count of the number of Tracks assigned or sent to them, rather than a discrete display of input channels, as their input source is usually from multiple Channels. Click on the Input area on a Bus or FX Channel to display a pop-up list of all assigned/sent Tracks. Clicking on a Track in this list selects and expands that Track in the Mix view.\nClick on any Input or Output to display and choose from a list of available routing options for any Channel. Clicking on the Input for an Instrument Channel opens the interface for the source virtual instrument.\nPanner and Fader All Channels feature a horizontal panner and vertical volume fader below the I/O-selection display. The panner can be clicked-and-dragged horizontally, allowing the audio for each Channel to be positioned left or right in the stereo field. The volume fader can be click-and-dragged vertically to control the output volume for each Channel. Numerical values may also be entered for pan and volume.\nStudio One uses a -3 dB pan law for all channel panning. On stereo Channels, the panner adjusts the balance of left and right signal levels.\nMute/Solo Channels can be muted or soloed by clicking on their Mute and Solo buttons, respectively. You can also press [M] for Mute or [S] for Solo on the keyboard to mute or solo selected Channels. Muting silences the Channel’s audio from the Console so you won’t hear it. Soloing silences all except the audio for the soloed Channel, so you only hear the soloed Channel. Any number of Channels can be muted or soloed at one time.\nWhen using the [M] or [S] keys to mute or solo an Instrument Track that has a virtual instrument attached to it, mute or solo is applied to the note data Track in the Arrangement view, rather than to the audio Track in the Mix view. [M] and [S] have no effect on Bus or FX Channels.\nYou can perform a Global Solo Off, which disengages Solo on any Track that has it engaged, by pressing and holding [Ctrl] on the keyboard and then clicking on any Solo button. Performing the [Ctrl]-click again recalls the previous solo settings, returning any previously soloed channels to the solo state. This can be useful when comparing a group of soloed Tracks to other Tracks in your mix.\nAutomation Mode The Automation mode for each Channel is displayed at the bottom of the Channel. By default, this mode is set to Off. Click on this display to choose an Automation mode or to add and remove automation parameters.\nName Channel names are shown at the bottom of each Channel in the Console. Double-click on the name, type a new name, and then press Enter to change the name of any Channel.\nExpand Channel All Channels feature an Expand Channel button, which expands the visible Channel to the right, revealing further Console routing possibilities. Audio, Instrument, and Bus Channels include Insert and Send Device Racks. FX Channels only have an Insert Device Rack.\nChannel Types Input Input Channels represent the configured hardware audio inputs. They can be mono or stereo, depending on the configuration of the hardware input they represent. Use the Input Channels to accurately meter inputs or to add effects processing to an input.\nAudio Audio Channels are direct representations of Audio Tracks in the Arrange view. Each Audio Track has a corresponding Audio Channel in the Console, with corresponding Record Enable, Monitor Enable, Solo, and Mute controls.\nInstrument Instrument Tracks in the Arrange view have no directly corresponding Channels. An Instrument Track outputs to a virtual instrument, and the virtual instrument then creates sound. Thus, virtual instruments output audio to Instrument Channels in the Console. A virtual instrument might have any number of outputs, as described in the Set Up Multiple Virtual Instrument Outputs section of the Recording chapter, and each has a corresponding Channel in the Console.\nBus The audio output of multiple Channels can be routed directly to a single Bus Channel, which is always a stereo Channel. This lets you create a submix so that the audio from several Channels can be processed together before being routed to the main output. Although less common, it is also possible to use Sends to route audio to Bus Channels.\nFor instance, several drum Tracks might be routed to a Drum Bus, where the audio is compressed and equalized, and then routed to the main output. That audio could also be routed to an FX Channel, through a Send, to apply a reverb effect, which would be applied to all audio routed to that FX Channel.\nFX FX Channels are what are traditionally known as effects return channels, used to apply effects to multiple signals simultaneously through the use of Sends. Audio can be routed from any Channel through a Send to an FX Channel, which can have any number of effects inserted in its Insert Device Rack. For instance, several keyboard Tracks and a guitar Track could be routed via Sends to an FX Channel with a reverb plug-in inserted, so that all of the instruments sound like they are in the same physical space.\nDragging an audio effect or FX Chain to the Send slot of a Channel in the Console creates a new FX Channel with the same name as the effect or FX Chain, and routes audio from the original Channel to the new FX Channel, via a Send.\nOutput Output Channels are routed directly to hardware audio outputs and can be stereo or mono, depending on the configured outputs to which they connect. Every Song has at least one stereo Output Channel, which is named Main Out by default. The Main Out is, by default, where the entire Console mix of all other Channels is routed. You generally listen to this output when monitoring your mix, as this is the output from which exported mixdowns are derived.\nThe Main Out Channel is always locked to the far right end of the Console and cannot be moved. This output features a stereo Peak/RMS Meter, as well as K-System Metering. Other configured hardware outputs are represented in the Console by a type of Output Channel called a Sub Out. Sub Outs appear to the right of the mixer when the Outputs panel is open.\nThe Main Out and Sub Out Channels feature Metronome controls, allowing independent metronome on/off and level control for each hardware output. Note that every stereo Output Channel also features a Mono switch to allow for quick summed-mono monitoring, which is commonly used to check a mix for mono compatibility.\nText and images reproduced from the official Studio One Version 3.3.0 Reference Manual\nCopyright © 2016 PreSonus Audio Electronics, Inc\n"

	"title": "The Grid",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": " The Arrangement grid is comprised of the ticks in the timeline and the vertical lines extending from those ticks through the background of the Arrangement. This grid uses the Timebase setting as the basis for its display. The Timebase settings are Seconds, Samples, Bars, and Frames, and they determine the behavior of Event and tool snapping. The Timebase can be changed at any time, without directly affecting the arrangement.\nPerhaps the most common Timebase setting is Bars, which display time in a musical format of bars and beats. With this Timebase setting, the grid is determined by the settings in the Quantize panel.\nQuantize Panel The Quantize panel can be opened from the toolbar by clicking on the Quantize Panel button, or by selecting Quantize from the View/Additional Views menu. The Quantize panel can be detached and freely placed on the screen. In this panel, you can edit all settings related to the Quantize grid that are displayed in the Arrangement. From left to right in the panel, you can see areas for Grid or Groove mode; note-value selection; note grouping and Swing amount; Start, End, Velocity, and Range percentages; and preset management.\nRhythmic Values With Grid mode selected, you can choose a note value between whole notes and 64th notes, and the following musical note groupings: Straight (with a Swing percentage setting), Triplet (3 notes in the space of 2), Quintole (a quintuplet with 5 notes in the space of 4), or Septole (a septuplet with 7 notes in the space of 8). These settings also determine the look and behavior of the grid in the Arrange view. For information on the Groove mode of the Quantize panel, refer to the Groove Extraction and Quantize section.\nSwing Swing is a rhythmic style you can apply, in which off-beats are moved forward in time relative to on-beat notes, creating a relaxed, bouncy feel. This offset is calculated based on the currently selected Quantize value. For example, at 100% Swing, with 16th-note quantize selected, a pattern of 16th notes play at a 2:1 ratio; On-beat notes play on beat, and offbeats play as though they were the final 16th-note triplet in a group of three. You can set the amount of swing between 0% (straight timing) and 100% (fully swung).\nQuantize Note Starts The Start percentage defaults to 100%, which means that the start of a selected note, Event, or transient snaps to the grid if quantized. This is effectively a quantize-strength parameter, where anything less than 100% moves the note, Event, or transient a relative amount closer to the grid, instead of all the way to the grid.\nQuantize Note Ends The End percentage only affects notes in Instrument Parts. The function is similar to the Start percentage, except that it affects the note end, effectively making quantized notes shorter or longer. The Velocity percentage also only affects notes, and adjusts note velocity according to an extracted groove if the Quantize mode is set to Groove.\nVelocity Sensitivity The Velocity percentage lets you tie Quantize strength to note velocity, to the degree that you specify.\nQuantize Range The Range percentage sets the relative range from grid lines within which notes, Events, or transients are quantized. Notes, Events, or transients beyond this relative range are not quantized. As there is no display indicating the Range, quantizing several times while adjusting this setting may lead to the best results.\nThe presets area of the Quantize panel allows you to quickly switch between up to five Quantize panel settings, so that working with multiple complex quantization setups is very easy. You can also store and recall Quantize panel settings, just as you would store an effect or instrument preset.\nText and images reproduced from the official Studio One Version 3.3.0 Reference Manual\nCopyright © 2016 PreSonus Audio Electronics, Inc\n"

	"content": " What is Automation? Automation lets you record changes in parameter values; thereafter, Studio One can perform these value changes for you. For instance, you can record level changes in a Track by capturing your fader movements during playback; from then on, Studio One can perform the level changes.\nBefore the advent of automation, mixing was very much a performance. Sometimes it took many pairs of hands on the mixing console to accomplish all of the fader, mute, solo, and other movements to achieve a mix. Automation makes it possible to record the mixing performance in any way you desire and endlessly tweak every parameter until the desired mix is achieved.\nIn Studio One, automation is recorded in automation envelopes, which are a series of data points connected by lines that represent the changing values of the parameter being automated.\nAutomation Envelopes On the Track To view automation envelopes one at a time, superimposed on top of Events on the Track, Press [A] on the keyboard or click on the Show Automation button at the top of the Track column in the Arrange view. With this engaged, the Track column of the Arrange view changes to reveal automation parameters, including an On/Off button, the parameter name for the currently shown Envelope, and automation mode selection.\nVolume Automation:\nClick on the Automation Parameter display, which is labeled “Display: Off” by default, to reveal the available automation envelopes for a Track (“Display: Off” indicates that the Events on the Track are displayed, instead of an automation envelope). Volume and Pan automation envelopes are available by default on every Audio Track.

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown. Markdown | Less | Pretty --- | --- | --- *Still* | `renders` | **nicely** 1 | 2 | 3  Colons can be used to align columns.\n   Tables Are Cool     col 3 is right-aligned $1600   col 2 is centered $12   zebra stripes are neat $1    There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.

Quote break. \u0026gt; This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.   Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.

Oh boy let\u0026rsquo;s keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone.

Use HTML tags.  Horizontal Rule Three or more... --- Hyphens *** Asterisks ___ Underscores  Three or more\u0026hellip;\nHyphens\nAsterisks\nUnderscores\nLine Breaks My basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover \u0026ndash; hit \u0026lt;Enter\u0026gt; once (i.e., insert one newline), then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens. You\u0026rsquo;ll soon learn to get what you want. \u0026ldquo;Markdown Toggle\u0026rdquo; is your friend.\nHere are some things to try out:\nHere's a line for us to start with. This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*. This line is also a separate paragraph, but... This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.  Here\u0026rsquo;s a line for us to start with.\nThis line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a separate paragraph.\nThis line is also begins a separate paragraph, but\u0026hellip;\nThis line is only separated by a single newline, so it\u0026rsquo;s a separate line in the same paragraph.\n(Technical note: Markdown Here uses GFM line breaks, so there\u0026rsquo;s no need to use MD\u0026rsquo;s two-space line breaks.)\nYouTube Videos They can\u0026rsquo;t be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:\n\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded\u0026amp;v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE \u0026quot; target=\u0026quot;_blank\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;240\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;180\u0026quot; border=\u0026quot;10\u0026quot; /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;  Or, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)  Referencing a bug by #bugID in your git commit links it to the slip.

You can download all files as one folder here. Open your DAW, create a new song/project with the title \u0026ldquo;YourFirstNameYourLastName-Lab1\u0026rdquo;. If prompted, use the following settings:   Sample Rate - 44.1kHz Resolution - 16 bit Tempo - 120 BPM   Drag one or multiple loop(s) onto new separate tracks in the arrange window. Using only the basic editing/splicing techniques - copying, reversing, and speed/pitch manipulations - create 2 different variations of the original loops, each on their own tracks, each at least 2 bars/measures in length. You may end up using more than 2 tracks in your project as you move Events around and audition different parts and clips. Name the tracks of the variations \u0026ldquo;Variation 1\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Variation 2\u0026rdquo; so that it is clear which ones are finished. Ensure that all of your edits are snapped to [The Grid](/computer-music/daw-instructions/the-grid/). When grid snapping is on, by default, regions and edits will snap to rhythmic divisions as you drag in the arrange window. To temporarily disable this behavior – e.g. if you need to make a tighter edit on an individual audio region – hold the shift key while dragging. If you notice the opposite behavior - that snapping only occurs while holding shift – simply press the N key to re-enable Snap to Grid. When you are finished, submit your project using the procedure in the [Basic Submission Instructions](/computer-music/daw-instructions/basic-submission-instructions/#submitting-a-song) document. As always, save a backup copy on your personal storage media.  "
